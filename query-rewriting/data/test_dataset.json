The validation results are saved in the Great Expectations Validation Store, but also returned as an CheckpointResult artifact that is versioned and saved in the ZenML Artifact Store. The step automatically rebuilds the Data Docs.\n\nAt a minimum, the step configuration expects the name of the Expectation Suite to be used for the validation:\n\nfrom

inserted into your pipeline where it can take in a pandas dataframe and a bool flag used solely for order reinforcement purposes, e.g.:\n\ndocker_settings =

{"anchor":"Reranking for better retrieval\n\nAdd reranking to your RAG inference for better retrieval performance.\n\nRerankers are a crucial component of retrieval systems that use LLMs. They help improve the quality of the retrieved documents by reordering them based on additional features or scores. In this section, we'll explore how to add a reranker to your RAG inference pipeline in ZenML.\n\nIn previous sections, we set up the overall workflow, from data ingestion and preprocessing to embeddings generation and retrieval. We then set up some basic evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our retrieval system. A reranker is a way to squeeze a bit of extra performance out of the system by reordering the retrieved documents based on additional features or scores.\n\nAs you can see, reranking is an optional addition we make to what we've already set up.

{"anchor":"e the new flavor in the list of available flavors:zenml image-builder flavor list\n\nIt is important to draw attention to when and how these base abstractions are coming into play in a ZenML workflow.\n\nThe CustomImageBuilderFlavor class is imported and utilized upon the creation of the custom flavor through the CLI.\n\nThe CustomImageBuilderConfig class is imported when someone tries to register\/update a stack component with this custom flavor. Especially, during the registration process of the stack component, the config will be used to validate the values given by the user. As Config objects are inherently pydantic objects, you can also add your own custom validators here.\n\nThe CustomImageBuilder only comes into play when the component is ultimately in use.\n\nThe design behind this interaction lets us separate the configuration of the flavor from its implementation. This way we can register flavors and components even when the major dependencies behind their implementation are not installed in our local setting (assuming the CustomImageBuilderFlavor and the CustomImageBuilderConfig are implemented in a different module\/path than the actual CustomImageBuilder).\n\nUsing a custom-build context\n\nThe BaseImageBuilder abstraction uses the build_context_class to provide a class that should be used as the build context. In case your custom image builder requires a different build context than the default Docker build context, you can subclass the BuildContext class to customize the structure of your build context.

SSH keys are long-lived credentials that give unrestricted access to HyperAI instances.\n\nWhen configuring the Service Connector, it is required to provide at least one hostname via hostnames and the username with which to login. Optionally, it is possible to provide an ssh_passphrase if applicable. This way, it is possible to use the HyperAI service connector in multiple ways:\n\nCreate one service connector per HyperAI instance with different SSH keys.\n\nConfigure a reused SSH key just once for multiple HyperAI instances, then select the individual instance when creating the HyperAI orchestrator component.\n\nAuto-configuration\n\nThis Service Connector does not support auto-discovery and extraction of authentication credentials from HyperAI instances.

{"anchor":"Version pipelines\n\nUnderstanding how and when the version of a pipeline is incremented.\n\nYou might have noticed that when you run a pipeline in ZenML with the same name, but with different steps, it creates a new version of the pipeline. Consider our example pipeline:\n\nfrom zenml import pipeline\n\n@pipeline\n\ndef first_pipeline(gamma: float = 0.002):\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = training_data_loader()\n\nsvc_trainer(gamma=gamma, X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nfirst_pipeline()\n\nRunning this the first time will create a single run for version 1 of the pipeline called first_pipeline.\n\n$python run.py\n\n...\n\nRegistered pipeline first_pipeline (version 1).\n\n...\n\nRunning it again (python run.py) will create yet another run for version 1 of the pipeline called first_pipeline. So now the same pipeline has two runs. You can also verify this in the dashboard.\n\nHowever, now let's change the pipeline configuration itself. You can do this by modifying the step connections within the @pipeline function or by replacing a concrete step with another one. For example, let's create an alternative step called digits_data_loader which loads a different dataset.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom zenml import step\n\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\n\n@step\n\ndef digits_data_loader() -> Tuple[\n\nAnnotated[pd.DataFrame, \"X_train\"],\n\nAnnotated[pd.DataFrame, \"X_test\"],\n\nAnnotated[pd.Series, \"y_train\"],\n\nAnnotated[pd.Series, \"y_test\"],\n\n]:\n\n\"\"\"Loads the digits dataset and splits it into train and test data.\"\"\"\n\n# Load data from the digits dataset\n\ndigits =

In order to see the full implementation and get the complete docstrings, please check the SDK docs .\n\nThe effect on the zenml.io.fileio\n\nIf you created an instance of an artifact store, added it to your stack, and activated the stack, it will create a filesystem each time you run a ZenML pipeline and make it available to the zenml.io.fileio module.\n\nThis means that when you utilize a method such as fileio.open(...) with a file path that starts with one of the SUPPORTED_SCHEMES within your steps or materializers, it will be able to use the open(...) method that you defined within your artifact store.\n\nBuild your own custom artifact store\n\nIf you want to implement your own custom Artifact Store, you can follow the following steps:\n\nCreate a class that inherits from the

When used by connector clients, they are provided a generic Python boto3 session instance pre-configured with AWS credentials. This session can then be used to create boto3 clients for any particular AWS service.\n\nThis generic AWS resource type is meant to be used with Stack Components that are not represented by other, more specific resource types, like S3 buckets, Kubernetes clusters, or Docker registries. It should be accompanied by a matching set of AWS permissions that allow access to the set of remote resources required by the client(s).\n\nThe resource name represents the AWS region that the connector is authorized to access.\n\nS3 bucket\n\nAllows users to connect to S3 buckets. When used by connector consumers, they are provided a pre-configured boto3 S3 client instance.\n\nThe configured credentials must have at least the following AWS IAM permissions associated with the ARNs of S3 buckets that the connector will be allowed to access (e.g. arn:aws:s3:::* and arn:aws:s3:::*\/* represent all the available S3 buckets).\n\ns3:ListBucket\n\ns3:GetObject\n\ns3:PutObject\n\ns3:DeleteObject\n\ns3:ListAllMyBuckets\n\nIf you are using the AWS IAM role, Session Token, or Federation Token authentication methods, you don't have to worry too much about restricting the permissions of the AWS credentials that you use to access the AWS cloud resources. These authentication methods already support automatically generating temporary tokens with permissions down-scoped to the minimum required to access the target resource.\n\nIf set, the resource name

{"anchor":"System Architectures\n\nDifferent variations of the ZenML Cloud architecture depending on your needs.\n\nIf you're interested in assessing ZenML Cloud, you can create a free account, which defaults to a Scenario 1 deployment. To upgrade to different scenarios, please reach out to us.\n\nThe ZenML Pro offers many additional features to increase your teams productivity. No matter your specific needs, the hosting options for ZenML Pro range from easy SaaS integration to completely airgapped deployments on your own infrastructure.\n\nA ZenML Pro deployment consists of the following moving pieces for both the SaaS product as well as the self-hosted version.:\n\nZenML Cloud API: This is a centralized MLOps control plane that includes a managed ZenML dashboard and a special ZenML server optimized for production MLOps workloads.\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO): The ZenML Cloud API is integrated with Auth0 as an SSO provider to manage user authentication and authorization. Users can log in to the ZenML Cloud dashboard using their social media accounts or their corporate credentials.\n\nSecrets Store: All secrets and credentials required to access customer infrastructure services are stored in a secure secrets store. The ZenML Cloud API has access to these secrets and uses them to access customer infrastructure services on behalf of the ZenML Cloud. The secrets store can be hosted either by the ZenML Cloud or by the customer.\n\nML Metadata Store: This is where all ZenML metadata is stored, including ML metadata such as tracking and versioning information about pipelines and models.\n\nThe above four interact with other MLOps stack components, secrets, and data in varying scenarios described below.\n\nScenario 1: Full SaaS\n\nIn this scenario, all services are hosted on the ZenML Cloud infrastructure. Customer secrets and credentials required to access customer infrastructure are stored and managed by the ZenML

{"anchor":"OUP> --project=<PROJECT> \\\n\n--token=<GITLAB_TOKEN>where <NAME> is the name of the code repository you are registering, <GROUP> is the group of the project, <PROJECT> is the name of the project, <GITLAB_TOKEN> is your GitLab Personal Access Token, and <GITLAB_URL> is the URL of the GitLab instance which defaults to https:\/\/gitlab.com. You will need to set a URL if you have a self-hosted GitLab instance.\n\nAfter registering the GitLab code repository, ZenML will automatically detect if your source files are being tracked by GitLab and store the commit hash for each pipeline run.\n\nGo to your GitLab account settings and click on Access Tokens.\n\nName the token and select the scopes that you need (e.g. read_repository, read_user, read_api)\n\nClick on \"Create personal access token\" and copy the token to a safe place.\n\nDeveloping a custom code repository\n\nIf you're using some other platform to store your code, and you still want to use a code repository in ZenML, you can implement and register a custom code repository.\n\nFirst, you'll need to subclass and implement the abstract methods of the zenml.code_repositories.BaseCodeRepository class:\n\nclass BaseCodeRepository(ABC):\n\n\"\"\"Base class for code repositories.\"\"\"\n\n@abstractmethod\n\ndef login(self) -> None:\n\n\"\"\"Logs into the code repository.\"\"\"\n\n@abstractmethod\n\ndef download_files(\n\nself, commit: str, directory: str, repo_sub_directory: Optional[str]\n\n) -> None:\n\n\"\"\"Downloads files from the code repository to a local directory.\n\nArgs:\n\ncommit: The commit hash to download files from.\n\ndirectory: The directory to download files to.\n\nrepo_sub_directory: The subdirectory in the repository

You can use the following code snippet to get the URL of the experiment tracker UI for the experiment linked to a certain step of your pipeline run:\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\npipeline_run

dashboard at a localhost port (if running locally) or through some other service that exposes your container to the internet.\n\nCLI Docker deployments\n\nIf you used the zenml up --docker CLI command to deploy the Docker ZenML server, you can check the logs with the command:\n\nzenml logs -f\n\nManual Docker deployments\n\nIf you used the docker run command to manually deploy the Docker ZenML

{"anchor":"s used for each run.\n\nCreating a GitHub RepositoryWhile ZenML supports many different flavors of git repositories, this guide will focus on GitHub. To create a repository on GitHub:\n\nSign in to GitHub.\n\nClick the \"+\" icon and select \"New repository.\"\n\nName your repository, set its visibility, and add a README or .gitignore if needed.\n\nClick \"Create repository.\"\n\nWe can now push our local code (from the previous chapters) to GitHub with these commands:\n\n# Initialize a Git repository\n\ngit init\n\n# Add files to the repository\n\ngit add .\n\n# Commit the files\n\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\n# Add the GitHub remote\n\ngit remote add origin https:\/\/github.com\/YOUR_USERNAME\/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git\n\n# Push to GitHub\n\ngit push -u origin master\n\nReplace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with your GitHub information.\n\nLinking to ZenML\n\nTo connect your GitHub repository to ZenML, you'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).\n\nGo to your GitHub account settings and click on Developer settings.\n\nSelect \"Personal access tokens\" and click on \"Generate new token\".\n\nGive your token a name and a description.\n\nWe recommend selecting the specific repository and then giving contents read-only access.\n\nClick on \"Generate token\" and copy the token to a safe place.\n\nNow, we can install the GitHub integration and register your repository:\n\nzenml integration install github\n\nzenml code-repository register <REPO_NAME> --type=github \\\n\n--url=https:\/\/github.com\/YOUR_USERNAME\/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git \\\n\n--owner=YOUR_USERNAME --repository=YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME \\\n\n--token=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\n\nFill in <REPO_NAME>, YOUR_USERNAME, YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME, and YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN with your details.\n\nYour code is now connected to your ZenML server.

{"anchor":"Load a Model in code\n\nThere are a few different ways to load a ZenML Model in code:\n\nLoad the active model in a pipeline\n\nYou can also use the active model to get the model metadata, or the associated artifacts directly as described in the starter guide:\n\nfrom zenml import step, pipeline, get_step_context, pipeline, Model\n\n@pipeline(model=Model(name=\"my_model\"))\n\ndef my_pipeline():\n\n...\n\n@step\n\ndef my_step():\n\n# Get model from active step context\n\nmv = get_step_context().model\n\n# Get metadata\n\nprint(mv.run_metadata[\"metadata_key\"].value)\n\n# Directly fetch an artifact that is attached to the model\n\noutput = mv.get_artifact(\"my_dataset\", \"my_version\")\n\noutput.run_metadata[\"accuracy\"].value\n\nLoad any model via the Client\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Client:\n\nfrom zenml import step\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\nfrom zenml.enums import ModelStages\n\n@step\n\ndef model_evaluator_step()\n\n...\n\n#

For small features and bug fixes, please open a pull request as described in the guide. For anything bigger, it is worth posting a message in Slack or creating an issue so we can best discuss and support your plans.\n\ncustom components: adding them to ZenML?\n\nPlease start by reading the general documentation page on implementing a custom stack component which offers some general advice on what you'll need to do.\n\nFrom there, each of the custom stack component types has a dedicated section about adding your own custom components. For example, for adding custom orchestrators you would visit this page.\n\ndependency clashes mitigation with ZenML?\n\nCheck out our dedicated documentation page on some ways you can try to solve these dependency and versioning issues.\n\ndeploy cloud infrastructure and\/or MLOps stacks?\n\nZenML is designed to be stack-agnostic, so you can use it with any cloud infrastructure or MLOps stack. Each of the documentation pages for stack components explain how to deploy these components on the most popular cloud providers.\n\nWe also build and maintain the mlstacks package and library which offers a dedicated way to spin up infrastructure for your ZenML pipelines. It's fully integrated into ZenML's CLI and is a great way to get started with deploying your infrastructure.

{"anchor":"s within a unique directory in the artifact store:Materializers are designed to be extensible and customizable, allowing you to define your own serialization and deserialization logic for specific data types or storage systems. By default, ZenML provides built-in materializers for common data types and uses cloudpickle to pickle objects where there is no default materializer. If you want direct control over how objects are serialized, you can easily create custom materializers by extending the BaseMaterializer class and implementing the required methods for your specific use case. Read more about materializers here.\n\nZenML provides a built-in CloudpickleMaterializer that can handle any object by saving it with cloudpickle. However, this is not production-ready because the resulting artifacts cannot be loaded when running with a different Python version. In such cases, you should consider building a custom Materializer to save your objects in a more robust and efficient format.\n\nMoreover, using the CloudpickleMaterializer could allow users to upload of any kind of object. This could be exploited to upload a malicious file, which could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.\n\nWhen a pipeline runs, ZenML uses the appropriate materializers to save and load artifacts using the ZenML fileio system (built to work across multiple artifact stores). This not only simplifies the process of working with different data formats and storage systems but also enables artifact caching and lineage tracking. You can see an example of a default materializer (the numpy materializer) in action here.\n\nPreviousHandle Data\/Artifacts\n\nNextReturn multiple outputs from a step\n\nLast updated 15 days

{"anchor":"Passing artifacts between pipelines\n\nStructuring an MLOps project\n\nAn MLOps project can often be broken down into many different pipelines. For example:\n\nA feature engineering pipeline that prepares raw data into a format ready to get trained.\n\nA training pipeline that takes input data from a feature engineering pipeline and trains a models on it.\n\nAn inference pipeline that runs batch predictions on the trained model and often takes pre-processing from the training pipeline.\n\nA deployment pipeline that deploys a trained model into a production endpoint.\n\nThe lines between these pipelines can often get blurry: Some use cases call for these pipelines to be merged into one big pipeline. Others go further and break the pipeline down into even smaller chunks. Ultimately, the decision of how to structure your pipelines depends on the use case and requirements of the project.\n\nNo matter how you design these pipelines, one thing stays consistent: you will often need to transfer or share information (in particular artifacts, models, and metadata) between pipelines. Here are some common patterns that you can use to help facilitate such an exchange:\n\nPattern 1: Artifact exchange between pipelines through Client\n\nLet's say we have a feature engineering pipeline and a training pipeline. The feature engineering pipeline is like a factory, pumping out many different datasets. Only a few of these datasets should be selected to be sent to the training pipeline to train an actual model.\n\nIn this scenario, the ZenML Client can be used to facilitate such an exchange:\n\nfrom

In addition to built-in Service Connector Types, ZenML can be easily extended with custom Service Connector implementations.\n\nTo discover the Connector Types available with your ZenML deployment, you can use the zenml service-connector list-types CLI command:\n\nzenml service-connector list-types\n\nExample Command

{"anchor":"s that the task requires at least 16 GB of memory.accelerators: The accelerators required. If a string, must be a string of the form 'V100' or 'V100:2', where the :2 indicates that the task requires 2 V100 GPUs. If a dict, must be a dict of the form {'V100': 2} or {'tpu-v2-8': 1}.\n\naccelerator_args: Accelerator-specific arguments. For example, {'tpu_vm': True, 'runtime_version': 'tpu-vm-base'} for TPUs.\n\nuse_spot: Whether to use spot instances. If None, defaults to False.\n\nspot_recovery: The spot recovery strategy to use for the managed spot to recover the cluster from preemption. Read more about the available strategies here\n\nregion: The cloud region to use.\n\nzone: The cloud zone to use within the region.\n\nimage_id: The image ID to use. If a string, must be a string of the image id from the cloud, such as AWS: 'ami-1234567890abcdef0', GCP: 'projects\/my-project-id\/global\/images\/my-image-name'; Or, a image tag provided by SkyPilot, such as AWS: 'skypilot:gpu-ubuntu-2004'. If a dict, must be a dict mapping from region to image ID.\n\ndisk_size: The size of the OS disk in GiB.\n\ndisk_tier: The disk performance tier to use. If None, defaults to 'medium'.\n\ncluster_name: Name of the cluster to create\/reuse. If None, auto-generate a name. SkyPilot uses term cluster to refer to a group or a single VM that are provisioned to execute the task. The cluster name is used to identify the cluster and to determine whether to reuse an existing cluster or create a new one.\n\nretry_until_up: Whether to retry launching the cluster until it is up.\n\nidle_minutes_to_autostop: Automatically stop the cluster after this many minutes of idleness, i.e., no running or pending jobs in the cluster's job queue. Idleness gets reset whenever setting-up\/running\/pending jobs are found in the job queue.

{"anchor":"Evidently\n\nHow to keep your data quality in check and guard against data and model drift with Evidently profiling\n\nThe Evidently Data Validator flavor provided with the ZenML integration uses Evidently to perform data quality, data drift, model drift and model performance analyses, to generate reports and run checks. The reports and check results can be used to implement automated corrective actions in your pipelines or to render interactive representations for further visual interpretation, evaluation and documentation.\n\nWhen would you want to use it?\n\nEvidently is an open-source library that you can use to monitor and debug machine learning models by analyzing the data that they use through a powerful set of data profiling and visualization features, or to run a variety of data and model validation reports and tests, from data integrity tests that work with a single dataset to model evaluation tests to data drift analysis and model performance comparison tests. All this can be done with minimal configuration input from the user, or customized with specialized conditions that the validation tests should perform.\n\nEvidently currently works with tabular data in pandas.DataFrame or CSV file formats and can handle both regression and classification tasks.\n\nYou should use the Evidently Data Validator when you need the following data and\/or model validation features that are possible with Evidently:\n\nData Quality reports and tests: provides detailed feature statistics and a feature behavior overview for a single dataset. It can also compare any two datasets.

{"anchor":"\ud83d\udc0dPython Client\n\nInteracting with your ZenML instance through the ZenML Client.\n\nPipelines, runs, stacks, and many other ZenML resources are stored and versioned in a database within your ZenML instance behind the scenes. The ZenML Python Client allows you to fetch, update, or even create any of these resources programmatically in Python.\n\nIn all other programming languages and environments, you can interact with ZenML resources through the REST API endpoints of your ZenML server instead. Checkout the \/docs\/ page of your server for an overview of all available endpoints.\n\nUsage Example\n\nThe following example shows how to use the ZenML Client to fetch the last 10 pipeline runs that you ran yourself on the stack that you have currently set:\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\nclient = Client()\n\nmy_runs_on_current_stack = client.list_pipeline_runs(\n\nstack_id=client.active_stack_model.id,  # on current stack\n\nuser_id=client.active_user.id,  # ran by you\n\nsort_by=\"desc:start_time\",  # last 10\n\nsize=10,\n\nfor pipeline_run in my_runs_on_current_stack:\n\nprint(pipeline_run.name)\n\nList of Resources\n\nThese are the main ZenML resources that you can interact with via the ZenML Client:\n\nPipelines, Runs, Artifacts\n\nPipelines: The pipeline (versions) that were implicitly tracked when running ZenML pipelines.\n\nPipeline Runs: Information about all pipeline runs that were executed on your ZenML instance.\n\nStep Runs: The steps of all pipeline runs.

If the credentials are invalid or if they lack the proper permissions to access the remote resource or service, you will only find this out later, when running a pipeline will fail at runtime.\n\nultimately, given that different Stack Component flavors rely on the same type of resource or cloud provider, it is not good design to duplicate the logic that handles authentication and authorization in each Stack Component implementation.\n\nThese drawbacks are addressed by Service Connectors.\n\nWithout Service Connectors, credentials are stored directly in the Stack Component configuration or ZenML Secret and are directly used in the runtime environment. The Stack Component implementation is directly responsible for validating credentials, authenticating and connecting to the infrastructure service. This is illustrated in the following diagram:\n\nWhen Service Connectors are involved in the authentication and authorization process, they can act as brokers. The credentials validation and authentication process takes place on the ZenML server. In most cases, the main credentials never have to leave the ZenML server as the Service Connector automatically converts them into short-lived credentials with a reduced set of privileges and issues these credentials to clients. Furthermore, multiple Stack Components of different flavors can use the same Service Connector to access different types or resources with the same

{"anchor":"the creation of the custom flavor through the CLI.The CustomModelRegistryConfig class is imported when someone tries to register\/update a stack component with this custom flavor. Most of all, during the registration process of the stack component, the config will be used to validate the values given by the user. As Config objects are pydantic objects under the hood, you can also add your own custom validators here.\n\nThe CustomModelRegistry only comes into play when the component is ultimately in use.\n\nThe design behind this interaction lets us separate the configuration of the flavor from its implementation. This way we can register flavors and components even when the major dependencies behind their implementation are not installed in our local setting (assuming the CustomModelRegistryFlavor and the

You can either install the entire integration or use a PyPI extra to install it independently of the integration:\n\npip install \"zenml[connectors-gcp]\" installs only prerequisites for the GCP Service Connector Type\n\nzenml integration install gcp installs the entire GCP ZenML integration\n\nIt is not required to install and set up the GCP CLI on your local machine to use the GCP Service Connector to link Stack Components to GCP resources and services. However, it is recommended to do so if you are looking for a quick setup that includes using the auto-configuration Service Connector features.\n\nThe auto-configuration examples in this page rely on the GCP CLI being installed and already configured with valid credentials of one type or another. If you want to avoid installing the GCP CLI, we recommend using the interactive mode of the ZenML CLI to register Service Connectors:\n\nzenml service-connector register -i --type gcp\n\nResource Types\n\nGeneric GCP resource\n\nThis resource type allows Stack Components to use the GCP Service Connector to connect to any GCP service or resource.

It assumes that the EKS cluster itself is already set up and configured with IAM access. For more information or tutorials for other clouds, check out the official Seldon Core installation instructions.\n\nConfigure EKS cluster access locally, e.g:\n\naws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name zenml-cluster --alias zenml-eks\n\nInstall Istio 1.5.0 (required for the latest Seldon Core version):\n\ncurl -L [https:\/\/istio.io\/downloadIstio](https:\/\/istio.io\/downloadIstio) | ISTIO_VERSION=1.5.0 sh -\n\ncd istio-1.5.0\/\n\nbin\/istioctl manifest apply --set profile=demo\n\nSet up an Istio gateway for Seldon Core:\n\ncurl https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/SeldonIO\/seldon-core\/master\/notebooks\/resources\/seldon-gateway.yaml | kubectl apply -f -\n\nInstall Seldon Core:\n\nhelm install seldon-core seldon-core-operator \\\n\n--repo https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/seldon-charts \\\n\n--set usageMetrics.enabled=true \\\n\n--set istio.enabled=true \\\n\n--namespace seldon-system\n\nTest that the installation is functional\n\nkubectl apply -f iris.yaml\n\nwith iris.yaml defined as follows:\n\napiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io\/v1\n\nkind: SeldonDeployment\n\nmetadata:\n\nname: iris-model\n\nnamespace: default\n\nspec:\n\nname: iris\n\npredictors:\n\ngraph:\n\nimplementation: SKLEARN_SERVER\n\nmodelUri: gs:\/\/seldon-models\/v1.14.0-dev\/sklearn\/iris\n\nname: classifier\n\nname: default\n\nreplicas: 1\n\nThen extract the URL where the model server exposes its prediction API:\n\nexport INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')\n\nAnd use curl to send a test prediction API request to the

{"anchor":"the gcloud auth application-default login command.By default, the GCP connector generates temporary OAuth 2.0 tokens from the user account credentials and distributes them to clients. The tokens have a limited lifetime of 1 hour. This behavior can be disabled by setting the generate_temporary_tokens configuration option to False, in which case, the connector will distribute the user account credentials JSON to clients instead (not recommended).\n\nThis method is preferred during development and testing due to its simplicity and ease of use. It is not recommended as a direct authentication method for production use cases because the clients are granted the full set of permissions of the GCP user account. For production, it is recommended to use the GCP Service Account or GCP Service Account Impersonation authentication methods.\n\nA GCP project is required and the connector may only be used to access GCP resources in the specified project.\n\nIf you already have the local GCP CLI set up with these credentials, they will be automatically picked up when auto-configuration is used (see the example below).\n\nThe following assumes the local GCP CLI has been configured with GCP user account credentials by running the gcloud auth application-default login command:\n\nzenml service-connector

In all other cases, you may safely ignore this section.\n\nThe LOCAL and REMOTE flags in the zenml service-connector list-types output indicate if the Service Connector implementation is available locally (i.e. where the ZenML client and pipelines are running) and remotely (i.e. where the ZenML server is running).\n\nAll built-in Service Connector Types are by default available on the ZenML server, but some built-in Service Connector Types require additional Python packages to be installed to be available in your local environment. See the section documenting each Service Connector Type to find what these prerequisites are and how to install them.\n\nThe local\/remote availability determines the possible actions and operations that can be performed with a Service Connector. The following are possible with a Service Connector Type that is available either locally or remotely:\n\nService Connector registration, update, and discovery (i.e. the zenml service-connector register, zenml service-connector update, zenml service-connector list and zenml service-connector describe CLI commands).\n\nService Connector verification: checking whether its configuration and

However, there is some configuration that is step-specific, meaning it cannot be applied at a pipeline level, but only at a step level.\n\nexperiment_tracker: Name of the experiment_tracker to enable for this step. This experiment_tracker should be defined in the active stack with the same name.\n\nstep_operator: Name of the step_operator to enable for this step. This step_operator should be defined in the active stack with the same name.\n\noutputs: This is configuration of the output artifacts of this step. This is further keyed by output name (by default, step outputs are named output).

{"anchor":"Understanding stacks\n\nLearning how to switch the infrastructure backend of your code.\n\nNow that we have ZenML deployed, we can take the next steps in making sure that our machine learning workflows are production-ready. As you were running your first pipelines, you might have already noticed the term stack in the logs and on the dashboard.\n\nA stack is the configuration of tools and infrastructure that your pipelines can run on. When you run ZenML code without configuring a stack, the pipeline will run on the so-called default stack.\n\nSeparation of code from configuration and infrastructure\n\nAs visualized in the diagram above, there are two separate domains that are connected through ZenML. The left side shows the code domain. The user's Python code is translated into a ZenML pipeline. On the right side, you can see the infrastructure domain, in this case, an instance of the default stack. By separating these two domains, it is easy to switch the environment that the pipeline runs on without making any changes in the code. It also allows domain experts to write code\/configure infrastructure without worrying about the other domain.\n\nThe default stack\n\nzenml stack describe lets you find out details about your active

{"anchor":"RAG with ZenML\n\nRAG is a sensible way to get started with LLMs.\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up RAG pipelines with ZenML, including data ingestion, index store management, and tracking RAG-associated artifacts.\n\nLLMs are a powerful tool, as they can generate human-like responses to a wide variety of prompts. However, they can also be prone to generating incorrect or inappropriate responses, especially when the input prompt is ambiguous or misleading. They are also (currently) limited in the amount of text they can understand and\/or generate. While there are some LLMs like Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro that can consistently handle 1 million tokens (small units of text), the vast majority (particularly the open-source ones currently available) handle far less.\n\nThe first part of this guide to RAG pipelines with ZenML is about understanding the basic components and how they work together. We'll cover the following topics:\n\nwhy RAG exists and what problem it solves\n\nhow to ingest and preprocess data that we'll use in our RAG pipeline\n\nhow to leverage embeddings to represent our

{"anchor":"sing a type annotation.\n\nTuple vs multiple outputsIt is impossible for ZenML to detect whether you want your step to have a single output artifact of type Tuple or multiple output artifacts just by looking at the type annotation.\n\nWe use the following convention to differentiate between the two: When the return statement is followed by a tuple literal (e.g. return 1, 2 or return (value_1, value_2)) we treat it as a step with multiple outputs. All other cases are treated as a step with a single output of type Tuple.\n\nfrom zenml import step\n\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\n\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\n# Single output artifact\n\n@step\n\ndef my_step() -> Tuple[int, int]:\n\noutput_value = (0, 1)\n\nreturn output_value\n\n# Single output artifact with variable length\n\n@step\n\ndef my_step(condition) -> Tuple[int, ...]:\n\nif condition:\n\noutput_value = (0, 1)\n\nelse:\n\noutput_value = (0, 1, 2)\n\nreturn output_value\n\n# Single output artifact using the `Annotated` annotation\n\n@step\n\ndef my_step() -> Annotated[Tuple[int, ...], \"my_output\"]:\n\nreturn 0, 1\n\n# Multiple output artifacts\n\n@step\n\ndef my_step() -> Tuple[int, int]:\n\nreturn 0, 1\n\n# Not allowed: Variable length tuple annotation when using\n\n# multiple output artifacts\n\n@step\n\ndef my_step() -> Tuple[int, ...]:\n\nreturn 0, 1\n\nStep output names\n\nBy default, ZenML uses the output name output for single output steps and output_0, output_1, ... for steps with multiple outputs. These output names are used to display your outputs in the dashboard and fetch them after your pipeline is finished.\n\nIf you want to use custom output names for your steps, use the Annotated type

{"anchor":"ing it easy to scale your RAG pipelines as needed.ZenML allows you to track all the artifacts associated with your RAG pipeline, from hyperparameters and model weights to metadata and performance metrics, as well as all the RAG or LLM-specific artifacts like chains, agents, tokenizers and vector stores. These can all be tracked in the Model Control Plane and thus visualized in the ZenML Cloud dashboard.\n\nBy bringing all of the above into a simple ZenML pipeline we achieve a clearly delineated set of steps that can be run and rerun to set up our basic RAG pipeline. This is a great starting point for building out more complex RAG pipelines, and it's a great way to get started with LLMs in a sensible way.\n\nA summary of some of the advantages that ZenML brings to the table here includes:\n\nReproducibility: You can rerun the pipeline to update the index store with new documents or to change the parameters of the chunking process and so on. Previous versions of the artifacts will be preserved, and you can compare the performance of different versions of the pipeline.\n\nScalability: You can easily scale the pipeline to handle larger corpora of documents by deploying it on a cloud provider and using a more scalable vector store.\n\nTracking artifacts and associating them with metadata: You can track the artifacts generated by the pipeline and associate them with metadata that provides additional context and insights into the pipeline. This metadata and these artifacts are then visible in the ZenML dashboard, allowing you to monitor the performance of the pipeline and debug any issues that arise.\n\nMaintainability - Having your pipeline in a clear, modular format makes it easier to maintain and update. You can easily add new steps, change the parameters of existing steps, and experiment with different configurations to see how they affect the performance of the pipeline.","filename":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/user-guide\/llmops-guide\/rag-with-zenml\/understanding-rag","parent_section":"user-guide","url":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/user-guide\/llmops-guide\/rag-with-zenml\/understanding-rag","embedding":[-0.0645379722,-0.0143661862,-0.0410818793,-0.0251874458,-0.0310685541,0.0257168077,-0.0471396744,-0.0217645653,-0.0689722449,0.0385395214,-0.0999271423,-0.0351995528,0.0767488033,-0.0068325424,-0.0129697509,0.0168151371,0.0365305133,0.0447151624,-0.102705501,-0.0304916967,-0.0132218758,-0.0558243282,-0.0062621851,-0.0075045181,-0.0840941817,0.0024655492,-0.1082479507,0.0034737634,0.0636082739,-0.069421418,0.0120791597,0.0152691416,0.0134205148,0.0263802353,-0.0134168882,0.1000813618,-0.0617999285,0.0012336683,-0.0244276207,-0.0178253297,0.099715814,0.0964169204,-0.0989882275,0.0363635756,-0.0668726414,-0.0609065108,-0.006690037,-0.0012284922,-0.0266112052,-0.0276829731,-0.0325916484,-0.086399287,0.0883061886,0.0211373791,-0.0921997204,-0.0432228632,0.0363923535,0.0477833226,-0.0517928861,-0.0648617819,-0.0212660134,-0.0087832958,-0.0524519905,0.0541411713,0.0200016294,-0.0122034885,0.0505966954,0.0112327784,0.0492569469,0.0375608206,-0.066326946,-0.047891032,0.0159257669,0.0330328196,-0.0338590369,0.0060950336,0.1113048196,-0.0061048046,0.0331075788,-0.0078648841,-0.0325570852,0.0028565002,0.0551933981,-0.0728810877,0.0471793823,-0.0151458057,-0.0118208406,-0.0135525148,0.0969544947,-0.018915657,0.0569170713,0.0181699004,-0.0048142676,0.0172292944,0.0077182935,0.0552968532,0.0573903807,-0.0506658293,0.0712389573,0.0105352281,-0.0558927469,-0.0269324016,0.0988645032,-0.0230251644,-0.0097464006,-0.0384522304,0.0340688527,0.0553464666,0.032144513,-0.0332732461,0.0117102433,0.0695314407,0.0018011443,-0.0450062603,0.0163022745,-0.0025909245,0.0214761831,-0.007735054,-0.0163391791,0.077358976,-0.0357035585,-0.056167312,-0.0238012783,0.028204916,0.048196435,0.0587030128,-0.0745655,-0.0252902266,0.0452597626,0.0022102785,0.0147454375,-0.0348332487,-0.0217667054,0.0458571874,0.0418594293,-0.010448304,0.0504702851,0.0437015817,0.0172849875,0.1311837733,-0.0613227561,-0.010157329,-0.0170752276,-0.0563083142,-0.0474145673,0.1008620933,0.0194605626,-0.0745187402,-0.0793778524,-0.0831283778,-0.0822897255,-0.0223269258,0.0256285332,-0.0044758576,0.0287562273,-0.0085653802,-0.06885425,0.0201032516,-0.0398434028,0.0547143482,0.0182867106,-0.0091993557,-0.0890002102,0.0505463444,-0.0625903308,-0.0462974608,-0.0233546048,0.0173492767,0.1120190695,-0.0148073696,0.0003357979,0.0691329166,-0.0939268246,-0.0750924274,0.026482936,-0.0539988764,0.0609732047,-0.0473487787,0.1004443988,0.0365840234,0.0540492274,0.0396815762,0.0027558233,-0.0209160279,-0.0736414716,0.0180012975,0.0336732864,0.0645154193,-0.0174021386,-0.0270647742,-0.0688289329,0.06251771,0.103518419,-0.0218473915,0.0590364076,0.0706251338,0.0219744593,-0.0339638963,-0.0194085781,-0.0517503172,-0.0412924066,0.0687231049,0.1024877131,-0.0023568529,-0.0060622673,-0.01366142,-0.0416325331,-0.0177965183,-0.0860407203,0.0273018163,-0.0109293591,0.0773302019,0.0271813124,0.0113319531,0.0333984047,0.0300034955,-0.031481687,0.0058046784,-0.0115676941,0.0887252092,0.0337968059,0.0362943597,-0.0267115533,4.959845599e-33,0.0662686676,0.022734452,0.0333555862,0.0859139636,0.1109719798,-0.0299256705,0.0458766334,-0.0294242091,-0.0116922874,0.0238991324,0.0177269056,-0.1004473716,-0.0377178043,-0.0154842427,0.0905465931,-0.1488167942,0.0348877087,0.0058421907,0.0789891854,0.050265912,-0.005738256,0.0381596945,-0.0389446728,0.0559413545,-0.0374157801,0.0195636824,-0.0371808261,-0.034824308,0.0037091207,-0.0226878673,-0.1189500988,-0.0157758612,0.0024271251,0.0028745234,0.0506740697,-0.1407316029,0.0004180537,0.0484567136,-0.0135410568,-0.0418522097,0.0348055884,-0.0031606851,-0.0417842641,-0.0324166231,-0.0361343995,-0.0013886839,-0.0271413811,0.0064727734,-0.0926275775,-0.0600716397,-0.0241384357,0.077151686,0.0055451412,-0.1148115173,-0.0153772393,0.0572930574,0.1074136719,0.0431375615,-0.0369432792,0.0256251637,-0.0447199903,0.0468443036,0.0263755061,-0.0487167686,-0.0044465959,-0.0087366495,0.037597537,-0.0306262393,-0.0965646729,-0.0861900225,-0.0595202371,-0.0456478782,0.040651124,0.0448307544,0.0222274289,-0.0532784611,0.0928558409,-0.0350082964,-0.0400145799,-0.0235596914,0.0186192896,-0.0269479845,0.031430494,-0.0755522922,0.0168986637,0.0217661913,0.0237764772,0.01495081,0.0445873737,0.0752497017,0.0167163964,0.0074724951,-0.0775062665,-0.0380037092,0.0132366251,5.477374032e-32,-0.0695580766,0.035721112,-0.0422744378,0.0141221043,-0.0668663085,-0.0253874343,0.0464647636,0.1442338079,-0.0233412683,0.0551287681,0.0970124304,-0.0951224267,0.0157181267,0.0589558817,0.0484415106,0.0485696867,0.0216644555,0.0938403606,-0.0335351005,-0.14786686,0.0196066163,0.0504330806,0.019965671,0.0242789816,0.0942038372,-0.0761362165,-0.0481126904,0.0204249676,0.0457271524,-0.0140742669,0.0126291709,0.0315762423,-0.0164894816,-0.0138045624,0.0341968611

{"anchor":"to your stack:\n\nzenml integration install wandb -yThe Weights & Biases Experiment Tracker needs to be configured with the credentials required to connect to the Weights & Biases platform using one of the available authentication methods.\n\nAuthentication Methods\n\nYou need to configure the following credentials for authentication to the Weights & Biases platform:\n\napi_key: Mandatory API key token of your Weights & Biases account.\n\nproject_name: The name of the project where you're sending the new run. If the project is not specified, the run is put in an \"Uncategorized\" project.\n\nentity: An entity is a username or team name where you're sending runs. This entity must exist before you can send runs there, so make sure to create your account or team in the UI before starting to log runs. If you don't specify an entity, the run will be sent to your default entity, which is usually your username.\n\nThis option configures the credentials for the Weights & Biases platform directly as stack component attributes.\n\nThis is not recommended for production settings as the credentials won't be stored securely and will be clearly visible in the stack configuration.\n\n# Register the Weights & Biases experiment tracker\n\nzenml experiment-tracker register wandb_experiment_tracker --flavor=wandb \\\n\n--entity=<entity> --project_name=<project_name> --api_key=<key>\n\n# Register and set a stack with the new experiment tracker\n\nzenml stack register custom_stack -e wandb_experiment_tracker ... --set\n\nThis method requires you to configure a ZenML secret to store the Weights & Biases tracking service credentials securely.\n\nYou can create the secret using the zenml secret create command:\n\nzenml secret create wandb_secret \\\n\n--entity=<ENTITY>

{"anchor":"Data ingestion and preprocessing\n\nUnderstand how to ingest and preprocess data for RAG pipelines with ZenML.\n\nThe first step in setting up a RAG pipeline is to ingest the data that will be used to train and evaluate the retriever and generator models. This data can include a large corpus of documents, as well as any relevant metadata or annotations that can be used to train the retriever and generator.\n\nIn the interests of keeping things simple, we'll implement the bulk of what we need ourselves. However, it's worth noting that there are a number of tools and frameworks that can help you manage the data ingestion process, including downloading, preprocessing, and indexing large corpora of documents. ZenML integrates with a number of these tools and frameworks, making it easy to set up and manage RAG pipelines.\n\nYou can view all the code referenced in this guide in the associated project repository. Please visit the llm-complete-guide project inside the ZenML projects repository if you want to dive deeper.\n\nYou can add a ZenML step that scrapes a series of URLs and outputs the URLs quite easily. Here we assemble a step that scrapes URLs related to ZenML from its documentation. We leverage some simple helper utilities that we have created for this purpose:\n\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\n\nfrom zenml import log_artifact_metadata, step\n\nfrom steps.url_scraping_utils import get_all_pages\n\n@step\n\ndef url_scraper(\n\ndocs_url: str = \"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\",\n\nrepo_url: str =

{"anchor":"Automatically retry steps\n\nAutomatically configure your steps to retry if they fail.\n\nZenML provides a built-in retry mechanism that allows you to configure automatic retries for your steps in case of failures. This can be useful when dealing with intermittent issues or transient errors. A common pattern when trying to run a step on GPU-backed hardware is that the provider will not have enough resources available, so you can set ZenML to handle the retries until the resources free up. You can configure three parameters for step retries:\n\nmax_retries: The maximum number of times the step should be retried in case of failure.\n\ndelay: The initial delay in seconds before the first retry attempt.\n\nbackoff: The factor by which the delay should be multiplied after each retry attempt.\n\nUsing the @step decorator:\n\nYou can specify the retry configuration directly in the definition of your step as follows:\n\nfrom zenml.config.retry_config import StepRetryConfig\n\n@step(\n\nretry=StepRetryConfig(\n\nmax_retries=3,\n\ndelay=10,\n\nbackoff=2\n\ndef my_step() -> None:\n\nraise Exception(\"This is a test exception\")\n\nsteps:\n\nmy_step:\n\nretry:\n\nmax_retries: 3\n\ndelay: 10\n\nbackoff: 2\n\nNote that infinite retries are not supported at the moment. If you set max_retries to a very large value or do not specify it at all, ZenML will still enforce an internal maximum number of retries to prevent infinite loops.

{"anchor":"GCP Service Connector\n\nConfiguring GCP Service Connectors to connect ZenML to GCP resources such as GCS buckets, GKE Kubernetes clusters, and GCR container registries.\n\nThe ZenML GCP Service Connector facilitates the authentication and access to managed GCP services and resources. These encompass a range of resources, including GCS buckets, GCR container repositories, and GKE clusters. The connector provides support for various authentication methods, including GCP user accounts, service accounts, short-lived OAuth 2.0 tokens, and implicit authentication.\n\nTo ensure heightened security measures, this connector always issues short-lived OAuth 2.0 tokens to clients instead of long-lived credentials unless explicitly configured to do otherwise. Furthermore, it includes automatic configuration and detection of credentials locally configured through the GCP CLI.\n\nThis connector serves as a general means of accessing any GCP service by issuing OAuth 2.0 credential objects to clients. Additionally, the connector can handle specialized authentication for GCS, Docker, and Kubernetes Python clients. It also allows for the configuration of local Docker and Kubernetes CLIs.\n\n$ zenml service-connector list-types --type

This is a required parameter.\n\nversion: version: The version of the model.\n\ntrained_model_name: Name of the model artifact in MLflow.\n\nmodel_source_uri: The path to the model. If not provided, the model will be fetched from the MLflow tracking server via the trained_model_name.\n\ndescription: A description of the model version.\n\nmetadata: A list of metadata to associate with the model version.\n\nThe model_source_uri parameter is the path to the model within the MLflow tracking server.\n\nIf you are using a local MLflow tracking server, the path will be something like file:\/\/\/...\/mlruns\/667102566783201219\/3973eabc151c41e6ab98baeb20c5323b\/artifacts\/model.\n\nIf you are using a remote MLflow tracking server, the path will be something like s3:\/\/...\/mlruns\/667102566783201219\/3973eabc151c41e6ab98baeb20c5323b\/artifacts\/model.\n\nYou can find the path of the model in the MLflow UI.

{"anchor":"306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql:8.0The ZenML client on the host machine can then be configured to connect directly to the database with a slightly different zenml connect command:\n\nzenml connect --url mysql:\/\/127.0.0.1\/zenml --username root --password password\n\nNote The localhost hostname will not work with MySQL databases. You need to use the 127.0.0.1 IP address instead.\n\nZenML server with docker-compose\n\nDocker compose offers a simpler way of managing multi-container setups on your local machine, which is the case for instance if you are looking to deploy the ZenML server container and connect it to a MySQL database service also running in a Docker container.\n\nTo use Docker Compose, you need to install the docker-compose plugin on your machine first.\n\nA docker-compose.yml file like the one below can be used to start and manage the ZenML server container and the MySQL database service all at once:\n\nversion: \"3.9\"\n\nservices:\n\nmysql:\n\nimage: mysql:8.0\n\nports:\n\n3306:3306\n\nenvironment:\n\nMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password\n\nzenml:\n\nimage: zenmldocker\/zenml-server\n\nports:\n\n\"8080:8080\"\n\nenvironment:\n\nZENML_STORE_URL=mysql:\/\/root:password@host.docker.internal\/zenml\n\nlinks:\n\nmysql\n\ndepends_on:\n\nmysql\n\nextra_hosts:\n\n\"host.docker.internal:host-gateway\"\n\nrestart: on-failure\n\nNote the following:\n\nZENML_STORE_URL is set to the special Docker host.docker.internal hostname to instruct the server to connect to the database over the Docker network.\n\nThe

You can use the following code snippet to get the URL of the experiment tracker UI for the experiment linked to a certain step of your pipeline run:\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\npipeline_run

{"anchor":"ials by impersonating another GCP service account.The connector needs to be configured with the email address of the target GCP service account to be impersonated, accompanied by a GCP service account key JSON for the primary service account. The primary service account must have permission to generate tokens for the target service account (i.e. the Service Account Token Creator role). The connector will generate temporary OAuth 2.0 tokens upon request by using GCP direct service account impersonation. The tokens have a configurable limited lifetime of up to 1 hour.\n\nThe best practice implemented with this authentication scheme is to keep the set of permissions associated with the primary service account down to the bare minimum and grant permissions to the privilege-bearing service account instead.\n\nA GCP project is required and the connector may only be used to access GCP resources in the specified project.\n\nIf you already have the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable configured to point to the primary service account key JSON file, it will be automatically picked up when auto-configuration is used.\n\nFor this example, we have the following set up in GCP:\n\na primary empty-connectors@zenml-core.iam.gserviceaccount.com GCP service account with no permissions whatsoever aside from the \"Service Account Token Creator\" role that allows it to impersonate the secondary service account below.

{"anchor":"ent.active_user.id,  # ran by you\n\nResource ModelsThe methods of the ZenML Client all return Response Models, which are Pydantic Models that allow ZenML to validate that the returned data always has the correct attributes and types. E.g., the client.list_pipeline_runs method always returns type Page[PipelineRunResponseModel].\n\nYou can think of these models as similar to types in strictly-typed languages, or as the requirements of a single endpoint in an API. In particular, they are not related to machine learning models like decision trees, neural networks, etc.\n\nZenML also has similar models that define which information is required to create, update, or search resources, named Request Models, Update Models, and Filter Models respectively. However, these models are only used for the server API endpoints, and not for the Client methods.\n\nTo find out which fields a specific resource model contains, checkout the ZenML Models SDK Documentation and expand the source code to see a list of all fields of the respective model.

{"anchor":"se Python <3.11 together with the GCP integration.The GCS Artifact Store flavor is provided by the GCP ZenML integration, you need to install it on your local machine to be able to register a GCS Artifact Store and add it to your stack:\n\nzenml integration install gcp -y\n\nThe only configuration parameter mandatory for registering a GCS Artifact Store is the root path URI, which needs to point to a GCS bucket and take the form gs:\/\/bucket-name. Please read the Google Cloud Storage documentation on how to configure a GCS bucket.\n\nWith the URI to your GCS bucket known, registering a GCS Artifact Store can be done as follows:\n\n# Register the GCS artifact store\n\nzenml artifact-store register gs_store -f gcp --path=gs:\/\/bucket-name\n\n# Register and set a stack with the new artifact store\n\nzenml stack register custom_stack -a gs_store ... --set\n\nDepending on your use case, however, you may also need to provide additional configuration parameters pertaining to authentication to match your deployment scenario.\n\nInfrastructure Deployment\n\nA GCS Artifact Store can be deployed directly from the ZenML CLI:\n\nzenml artifact-store deploy gcs_artifact_store --flavor=gcp --provider=gcp ...\n\nYou can pass other configurations specific to the stack components as key-value arguments. If you don't provide a name, a random one is generated for you. For more information about how to work use the CLI for this, please refer to the dedicated documentation section.\n\nAuthentication Methods\n\nIntegrating and using a GCS Artifact Store in your pipelines is not possible without employing some form of authentication. If you're looking for a quick way to get started locally, you can use the Implicit Authentication method. However, the recommended way to authenticate to the GCP cloud platform is through a GCP Service Connector. This is particularly useful if you are configuring ZenML stacks that combine the GCS Artifact Store with other remote stack components also running in

{"anchor":"something with the annotations\n\nreturn annotationsIf you're running in a cloud environment, you can manually export the annotations, store them somewhere in a cloud environment and then reference or use those within ZenML. The precise way you do this will be very case-dependent, however, so it's difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nProdigy Annotator Stack Component\n\nOur Prodigy annotator component inherits from the BaseAnnotator class. There are some methods that are core methods that must be defined, like being able to register or get a dataset. Most annotators handle things like the storage of state and have their own custom features, so there are quite a few extra methods specific to Prodigy.\n\nThe core Prodigy functionality that's

For a full list of permissions required to use an AWS Service Connector to access one or more S3 buckets, please refer to the Azure Service Connector Blob storage container resource type documentation or read the documentation available in the interactive CLI commands and dashboard. The Azure Service Connector supports many different authentication methods with different levels of security and convenience. You should pick the one that best fits your use-case.\n\nIf you already have one or more Azure Service Connectors configured in your ZenML deployment, you can check which of them can be used to access the Azure Blob storage container you want to use for your Azure Artifact Store by running e.g.:\n\nzenml service-connector list-resources --resource-type blob-container\n\nExample Command

{"anchor":"Adding it to a stack is as simple as running e.g.:# Register the whylogs data validator\n\nzenml data-validator register whylogs_data_validator --flavor=whylogs\n\n# Register and set a stack with the new data validator\n\nzenml stack register custom_stack -dv whylogs_data_validator ... --set\n\nAdding WhyLabs logging capabilities to your whylogs Data Validator is just slightly more complicated, as you also need to create a ZenML Secret to store the sensitive WhyLabs authentication information in a secure location and then reference the secret in the Data Validator configuration. To generate a WhyLabs access token, you can follow the official WhyLabs instructions documented here .\n\nThen, you can register the whylogs Data Validator with WhyLabs logging capabilities as follows:\n\n# Create the secret referenced in the data validator\n\nzenml secret create whylabs_secret \\\n\n--whylabs_default_org_id=<YOUR-WHYLOGS-ORGANIZATION-ID> \\\n\n--whylabs_api_key=<YOUR-WHYLOGS-API-KEY>\n\n# Register the whylogs data validator\n\nzenml data-validator register whylogs_data_validator --flavor=whylogs \\\n\n--authentication_secret=whylabs_secret\n\nYou'll also need to enable whylabs logging for your custom pipeline steps if you want to upload the whylogs data profiles that they return as artifacts to the WhyLabs platform. This is enabled by default for the standard whylogs step. For custom steps, you can enable WhyLabs logging by setting the upload_to_whylabs parameter to True in the step configuration, e.g.:\n\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated  # or `from typing

{"anchor":"Understanding reranking\n\nUnderstand how reranking works.\n\nWhat is reranking?\n\nReranking is the process of refining the initial ranking of documents retrieved by a retrieval system. In the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), reranking plays a crucial role in improving the relevance and quality of the retrieved documents that are used to generate the final output.\n\nThe initial retrieval step in RAG typically uses a sparse retrieval method, such as BM25 or TF-IDF, to quickly find a set of potentially relevant documents based on the input query. However, these methods rely on lexical matching and may not capture the semantic meaning or context of the query effectively.\n\nRerankers, on the other hand, are designed to reorder the retrieved documents by considering additional features, such as semantic similarity, relevance scores, or domain-specific knowledge. They aim to push the most relevant and informative documents to the top of the list, ensuring that the LLM has access to the best possible context for generating accurate and coherent responses.\n\nTypes of Rerankers\n\nThere are different types of rerankers that can be used in RAG, each with its own strengths and trade-offs:\n\nCross-Encoders: Cross-encoders are a popular choice for reranking in RAG. They take the concatenated query and document as input and output a relevance score. Examples include BERT-based models fine-tuned for passage ranking tasks. Cross-encoders can capture the interaction between the query and document effectively but are computationally expensive.\n\nBi-Encoders: Bi-encoders, also known as dual encoders, use separate encoders for the query and document. They generate embeddings for the query and document independently and then compute the similarity between them. Bi-encoders are more efficient than cross-encoders but may not capture the query-document interaction as effectively.","filename":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/v\/docs\/user-guide\/llmops-guide\/reranking\/understanding-reranking","parent_section":"user-guide","url":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/v\/docs\/user-guide\/llmops-guide\/reranking\/understanding-reranking","embedding":[-0.0240723044,-0.0055026882,-0.0633724928,-0.0110395569,-0.0356216691,0.1230970472,-0.0851172134,0.0502010919,-0.0047176532,0.0410474688,0.0042606867,0.0184657406,0.0398680419,0.0592291132,-0.0819611847,0.0204241388,0.1032988131,0.0481285267,-0.1133280247,-0.0390961431,-0.0303772446,-0.0689689592,0.0771992058,-0.0961881876,0.0439696051,-0.0346607827,-0.0846478045,0.057731282,0.0459011868,-0.0689543411,0.022178242,0.0198347997,-0.0100436229,0.0354118347,-0.0159568917,0.0304681342,-0.0494614802,-0.0009259103,0.0236131046,0.0349407345,0.034441527,-0.0831572786,-0.0512249209,0.0133090317,-0.0050659198,0.0068460396,-0.0002247192,0.0686553493,-0.1242933124,-0.0080743525,-0.067792818,-0.0583252981,-0.0210900512,0.0726396888,-0.0125407428,0.0766965598,-0.0064739706,-0.0257395394,-0.0045931377,-0.007363678,-0.0048270351,-0.0069181519,0.0022261529,-0.014447974,0.0563672297,-0.0085313804,-0.0279822983,-0.0202094521,-0.0557420738,0.0636886433,-0.0285679922,-0.0371594541,-0.0758868903,0.0565466844,-0.031567838,0.0617244542,0.0413411371,-0.0378912911,0.0506820306,0.0067119836,0.0148882233,0.0287056379,-0.0333422981,-0.0517553538,0.0233477019,-0.1233247891,0.0529007763,-0.101506412,0.032874871,0.0560302027,0.0079400381,-0.0922845379,0.0589498654,0.0858923122,0.0289384071,-0.0434323214,-0.0110508967,-0.0667421967,0.0894180313,0.0055753435,-0.126385808,0.0579146333,-0.0316665582,0.0205862913,-0.0418510884,-0.0163360853,0.0768479183,-0.0163900051,-0.004281702,-0.0397835709,0.0040413341,0.0134496903,0.0539261252,0.0132560907,0.0306878686,0.0798852891,0.0119166691,-0.0088205514,-0.0586110055,0.0407413431,-0.0727373436,-0.0545835719,-0.0629547536,-0.0254323874,0.023369018,0.0314135626,0.0006557562,-0.0483556055,0.0699811578,-0.0033698138,-0.0113058211,0.0021826641,-0.0468131602,-0.0176458191,-0.0072008455,0.0518622212,-0.0401874408,-0.0666785911,-0.0672689453,0.1406393796,0.015801819,0.0146227255,0.0579305887,-0.0588536896,-0.0810756087,0.074774906,-0.067255497,-0.074181281,-0.0601502955,0.0167807937,0.0344524533,-0.0484202951,-0.0337823555,0.0345026366,-0.0115672927,-0.0731336698,-0.0062971511,0.0031295186,0.005735077,-0.0266706739,0.0266833287,-0.0210062675,-0.0498695746,-0.0384524465,0.0771590993,0.0066296551,0.0385826416,-0.0164353717,-0.1136214882,-0.0014317746,0.1125243604,-0.0289959684,-0.0299402419,0.1146560833,-0.0238763168,0.1075813025,-0.0438051708,-0.0219702031,0.0980390832,0.0206814669,-0.0004258072,-0.033217255,-0.0374596305,0.0860821083,-0.051278241,-0.0342956372,-0.0174181927,-0.0241221488,0.0347219482,0.0358309969,-0.0072068688,0.0518486388,0.0686864555,-0.0562967695,0.0268775243,0.0255327784,0.0713460743,-0.0336129665,0.0261874888,-0.0303464197,-0.0474664308,-0.0286926702,0.0175356511,0.0131357312,0.0342224166,0.0075373286,0.0506026968,-0.0831643268,-0.0067871753,0.0047090608,-0.0060451361,0.0440072417,-0.0422692932,0.0004995594,0.0181167945,-0.0927569047,-0.0046517197,-0.0164196678,0.0060547171,0.069527775,0.0557182096,-0.0146024805,0.0652268827,9.975560975e-33,0.0140030421,0.0374052934,-0.0349750742,0.0453537367,-0.0619315058,-0.0243761297,-0.0299842414,-0.0523998104,-0.0006686739,-0.0182348173,-0.0933974981,-0.0844991431,0.019422885,0.0056767552,-0.047229711,-0.0948833749,0.0422515161,0.107806839,0.0587621443,0.1139803827,0.0573876686,0.0780009553,-0.026329929,0.1000728905,0.0341226384,-0.0188221373,0.0831956863,-0.0303529259,-0.0019704602,-0.0177709721,-0.0024521432,-0.0258178227,-0.0453079455,0.0034566268,0.0456070863,0.015120483,0.0111805815,-0.0686822832,-0.0515751317,0.0140960598,0.021910226,0.0778407976,-0.0670078844,-0.0222370028,-0.0722301528,-0.0279072672,-0.0430090725,0.0588985421,0.0956531912,-0.0902358964,0.0116278343,0.014832587,0.035342589,-0.0424952582,0.0033891317,0.0425446443,-0.0048394324,0.0381476507,-0.0972943977,0.0273940731,0.0193416439,0.000784222,-0.067507714,0.0396410674,-0.0188396573,0.0231385529,0.0392136276,-0.0399991237,-0.0583303496,-0.0007123613,-0.0278635584,0.0601533726,0.0299828257,-0.097939916,-0.0732366145,0.0272236355,-0.0083318977,0.0191242248,-0.057773564,0.0085843364,-0.0421524681,0.0537498184,-0.0459984466,-0.0196260121,-0.0272541251,0.0383681208,0.051860936,0.0720862076,0.0634545088,-0.0232553221,0.0164284576,-0.0566555113,-0.0333082788,-0.0110200224,0.0261475537,6.677748896e-32,0.0021689145,-0.0106205186,-0.0577214547,0.0950185061,0.0457119606,0.0463563427,0.0876438618,0.1222041994,0.0507403426,0.0319810174,0.0289770141,-0.0577710047,0.0170428287,-0.0410624482,0.0578007996,0.0303040519,0.0756075084,-0.0648662373,-0.0696327165,-0.0609785728,0.0463426635,0.0109930988,0.0549085103,0.0416148305,0.003709882,-0.0517606549,-0.0588703342,-0.0485534146,-0.002233448,-0.0173407327,0.0113274548,0.0986636877,-0.022

Read on to find detailed explanations on prerequisites, configuration, and deployment scenarios.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou'll need the following:\n\nA Kubernetes cluster\n\nOptional, but recommended: a MySQL-compatible database reachable from the Kubernetes cluster (e.g. one of the managed databases offered by Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure). A MySQL server version of 8.0 or higher is required\n\nthe Kubernetes client already installed on your machine and configured to access your cluster\n\nHelm installed on your machine\n\nOptional: an external Secrets Manager service (e.g. one of the managed secrets management services offered by Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, or HashiCorp Vault). By default, ZenML stores secrets inside the SQL database that it's connected to, but you also have the option of using an external cloud Secrets Manager service if you already happen to use one of those cloud or service providers\n\nZenML Helm Configuration\n\nYou can start by taking a look at the values.yaml file and familiarize yourself with some of the configuration settings that you can customize for your ZenML deployment.\n\nIn addition to tools and infrastructure, you will also need to collect and prepare information related to your database and information related to your external

{"anchor":"Artifact Store and the local filesystem or memory.When calling the Artifact Store API, you should always use URIs that are relative to the Artifact Store root path, otherwise, you risk using an unsupported protocol or storing objects outside the store. You can use the Repository singleton to retrieve the root path of the active Artifact Store and then use it as a base path for artifact URIs, e.g.:\n\nimport os\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\nfrom zenml.io import fileio\n\nroot_path = Client().active_stack.artifact_store.path\n\nartifact_contents = \"example artifact\"\n\nartifact_path = os.path.join(root_path, \"artifacts\", \"examples\")\n\nartifact_uri = os.path.join(artifact_path, \"test.txt\")\n\nfileio.makedirs(artifact_path)\n\nwith fileio.open(artifact_uri, \"w\") as f:\n\nf.write(artifact_contents)\n\nWhen using the Artifact Store API to write custom Materializers, the base artifact URI path is already provided. See the documentation on Materializers for an example.\n\nThe following are some code examples showing how to use the Artifact Store API for various operations:\n\ncreating folders, writing and reading data directly to\/from an artifact store object\n\nimport os\n\nfrom zenml.utils import io_utils\n\nfrom zenml.io import fileio\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\nroot_path =

{"anchor":".\n\nAuthentication Methods\n\nImplicit authenticationImplicit authentication to AWS services using environment variables, local configuration files or IAM roles.\n\nThis method may constitute a security risk, because it can give users access to the same cloud resources and services that the ZenML Server itself is configured to access. For this reason, all implicit authentication methods are disabled by default and need to be explicitly enabled by setting the ZENML_ENABLE_IMPLICIT_AUTH_METHODS environment variable or the helm chart enableImplicitAuthMethods configuration option to true in the ZenML deployment.\n\nThis authentication method doesn't require any credentials to be explicitly configured. It automatically discovers and uses credentials from one of the following sources:\n\nenvironment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION)\n\nlocal configuration files set up through the AWS CLI (~\/aws\/credentials, ~\/.aws\/config)\n\nIAM roles for Amazon EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, etc. Only works when running the ZenML server on an AWS resource with an IAM role attached to it.\n\nThis is the quickest and easiest way to authenticate to AWS services. However, the results depend on how ZenML is deployed and the environment where it is used and is thus not fully reproducible:\n\nwhen used with the default local ZenML deployment or a local ZenML server, the credentials are the same as those used by the AWS CLI or extracted from local environment variables\n\nwhen connected to a ZenML server, this method only works if the ZenML server is deployed in AWS and will use the IAM role attached to the AWS resource where the ZenML server is running (e.g. an EKS cluster). The IAM role permissions may need to be adjusted to allow listing and accessing\/describing the AWS resources that the connector is configured to access.","filename":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/how-to\/auth-management\/aws-service-connector","parent_section":"how-to","url":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/how-to\/auth-management\/aws-service-connector","embedding":[-0.008977605,0.0829483047,-0.0600985959,0.0389218293,0.0223184861,0.0502845347,0.0430281684,-0.054006014,-0.0072609517,0.0503562652,0.0213653091,-0.0024204468,0.0216841642,-0.0183473285,0.0459019952,0.0654704347,0.0179766379,-0.0209462084,-0.0261057299,0.0047073117,-0.0233828612,-0.0135605289,0.0135310525,0.0280590113,-0.0389772579,-0.0655555576,-0.0659692213,-0.0181672368,0.0224289838,0.0302884001,0.0589533933,0.0101602906,-0.0571715124,-0.0052004969,-0.0320361964,0.0351472199,0.0300278142,-0.0098890169,-0.0412461236,-0.0992174149,0.0466771275,0.0396101139,-0.1015879437,0.0110620707,0.0039080149,-0.0246454645,-0.0198804196,-0.0055139055,-0.0296252239,-0.0888196155,0.0064011612,0.0157181136,0.092775099,-0.0335421488,-0.0744450018,0.0007172376,-0.0538117103,0.0622729436,-0.0453658737,-0.0449472517,0.0384660847,0.084397234,-0.0732686371,-0.004713445,-0.0513456054,0.0396509655,0.0391193107,-0.0324190073,0.0302561205,0.0071503711,-0.0049948171,-0.0144708157,-0.1267016828,0.0031224811,0.0209349748,0.0060319128,0.0536595322,0.0103117581,0.0104506975,-0.1002303287,-0.0703664869,0.0452740602,0.0735479742,0.0516994931,0.0356931649,0.041405268,-0.0086032627,-0.1221881881,0.0588337965,-0.0007596107,0.0290025938,-0.029849451,-0.0653055981,-0.0933138952,0.1261288673,-0.1301616877,-0.0158115942,0.0381015018,0.002457194,-0.0103698643,-0.1043633744,0.0095119346,-0.0562007353,-0.0300437752,0.0629400462,0.0233426709,0.0168733764,0.0055532297,0.0163749047,-0.0137930773,0.0070255478,-0.0447245985,0.0274722837,-0.0030792744,-0.0260368194,0.0083829062,0.0465624072,-0.065951325,0.0064682867,-0.020942105,0.0203869026,-0.0519378744,0.0714204982,-0.0282060467,0.0271338653,-0.0092308866,-0.0522891358,-0.0508436225,0.0131233595,0.0277557708,0.0262924992,-0.0537113026,-0.0066958116,0.0007449952,-0.0016860365,-0.0500781126,0.1038861945,0.0402973816,0.0672387555,0.1195432097,0.0593610741,0.0051145116,0.0231055617,0.0865466967,0.0446820259,0.0261865985,-0.0005552783,0.0463128276,0.0036663031,-0.0250544213,-0.0183635559,0.0174051356,0.0039813281,-0.0155989658,0.0755415261,-0.0214357376,-0.0290354285,-0.0426760726,0.0011474089,0.031224668,0.002303401,-0.0101402756,-0.0758072287,0.0653989837,-0.0247355215,0.0273115747,-0.0937123075,0.0491031222,0.0231872834,-0.0676643252,-0.0411543846,-0.0126690818,-0.0531194434,-0.0232120063,-0.0602174848,-0.034501683,0.0718533397,-0.0069757127,-0.0283550061,0.0017826452,0.0113469502,-0.0535614826,-0.0451005436,-0.0820395201,-0.0730927214,0.051400654,-0.0326578915,-0.0137479706,0.0627675951,-0.0802826062,-0.0898732319,-0.0036102033,0.0223436449,0.0053440398,0.0086024543,-0.0024494135,0.0765292123,-0.1228026226,0.0581519119,0.0207536649,-0.0104393,0.0003197719,0.0597588941,0.0599980839,0.0206959806,0.012225911,0.1306938827,-0.0132855335,-0.0940473229,0.0527216047,0.0770393834,0.0433551036,-0.049781587,0.0817930624,-0.0432553738,0.0382036939,-0.0317211635,-0.0158371907,0.107647188,0.0181425456,0.0318407193,-0.0441144668,-0.1421188265,6.940789506e-34,-0.0003689949,-0.0174292382,0.0106394058,-0.0038118998,0.0712975487,-0.050032828,0.0829288363,-0.0200423207,0.0215471424,-0.0192340016,0.0905173868,-0.0245242622,-0.001699341,-0.0324030258,0.0447982326,-0.1280632019,-0.0477675237,0.0541186854,0.0017796996,0.0210897774,-0.0361690558,-0.0174746644,0.0608056635,-0.0543778874,-0.0176584031,0.0547108129,-0.0888914242,-0.0349986702,-0.0524152033,-0.0077528218,-0.0195903126,0.0917921215,-0.0521105975,0.066268377,0.0590537526,-0.1114045233,-0.0999988168,0.0242806897,-0.1118689477,-0.1080392599,0.0513904914,-0.0075068553,0.0582000464,0.0325070508,-0.066076614,0.0613645613,-0.0519042574,-0.134590745,-0.0286174491,-0.0235038083,-0.0165457986,-0.0430928767,0.0105074272,-0.0358137675,-0.0304401219,0.0625457987,-0.0272989571,0.0709163323,0.0573257096,0.0522890538,0.0501262955,-0.0038657605,0.0237439889,0.0024704584,-0.0206257608,-0.05091336,0.0318362564,0.0214593317,-0.028180521,-0.0231793858,0.0335980393,-0.0938806981,0.0518553741,0.012960555,0.0135905715,0.0788514465,0.0376613066,0.0620445348,-0.0118210306,-0.0813631564,0.0567760393,-0.0316996463,0.0277051218,-0.0248859301,0.0250876732,-0.0600154996,0.0588239282,-0.0179183576,0.0238847844,0.0563371666,0.0741863102,-0.0732200891,-0.0616232008,0.0474753678,0.0223885439,7.485984134e-32,0.0009590636,-0.0297423899,-0.0638796836,0.0738816783,-0.0459996052,0.0428451449,0.0348874852,0.0076291529,-0.0231180806,0.0253151488,0.026784366,-0.146898672,0.1011045128,0.0020159385,0.0075512165,0.0441425033,0.033790078,0.0377263613,-0.0347982645,-0.0086047612,-0.0557401553,0.029403029,-0.0874984935,-0.024772903,0.034375675,0.0105234832,-0.0311794523,0.0228276383,0.060796719,0.0329669081,-0.0257311165,0.0241340119,0.0181528963,0.0091813821,-0.1008676738,0.0459902473,-0.0109524662,-0.02

The connector provides\n\nsupport for various authentication methods, including explicit long-lived AWS\n\nsecret keys, IAM roles, short-lived STS tokens and implicit authentication.\n\nTo ensure heightened security measures, this connector also enables the\n\ngeneration of temporary STS security tokens that are scoped down to the minimum\n\npermissions necessary for accessing the intended resource.

{"anchor":"g version\/stage.\n\nFetching model versions by stageA common pattern is to assign a special stage to a model version, i.e. production, staging, development etc. This marks this version especially, and can be used to fetch it using a particular semantic meaning, disconnected from the concrete model version. A model version can be assigned a particular stage in the dashboard or by executing the following command in the CLI:\n\nzenml model version update MODEL_NAME --stage=STAGE\n\nThese stages can then be passed in as a version to fetch the right model version at a later point:\n\nfrom zenml import Model, step, pipeline\n\nmodel= Model(\n\nname=\"my_model\",\n\nversion=\"production\"\n\n# The step configuration will take precedence over the pipeline\n\n@step(model=model)\n\ndef svc_trainer(...) -> ...:\n\n...\n\n# This configures it for all steps within the pipeline\n\n@pipeline(model=model)\n\ndef training_pipeline( ... ):\n\n# training happens here\n\nAutonumbering of versions\n\nZenML automatically numbers your model versions for you. If you don't specify a version number, or if you pass None into the version argument of the Model object, ZenML will automatically generate a version number (or a new version, if you already have a version) for you. For example if we had a model version really_good_version for model my_model and we wanted to create a new version of this model, we could do so as follows:\n\nfrom zenml import Model, step\n\nmodel = Model(\n\nname=\"my_model\",\n\nversion=\"even_better_version\"\n\n@step(model=model)\n\ndef svc_trainer(...) -> ...:\n\n...\n\nA new model version will be created and ZenML will track that this is the next in the iteration sequence of the models using the number property.

{"anchor":"Data ingestion and preprocessing\n\nUnderstand how to ingest and preprocess data for RAG pipelines with ZenML.\n\nThe first step in setting up a RAG pipeline is to ingest the data that will be used to train and evaluate the retriever and generator models. This data can include a large corpus of documents, as well as any relevant metadata or annotations that can be used to train the retriever and generator.\n\nIn the interests of keeping things simple, we'll implement the bulk of what we need ourselves. However, it's worth noting that there are a number of tools and frameworks that can help you manage the data ingestion process, including downloading, preprocessing, and indexing large corpora of documents. ZenML integrates with a number of these tools and frameworks, making it easy to set up and manage RAG pipelines.\n\nYou can view all the code referenced in this guide in the associated project repository. Please visit the llm-complete-guide project inside the ZenML projects repository if you want to dive deeper.\n\nYou can add a ZenML step that scrapes a series of URLs and outputs the URLs quite easily. Here we assemble a step that scrapes URLs related to ZenML from its documentation. We leverage some simple helper utilities that we have created for this purpose:\n\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\n\nfrom zenml import log_artifact_metadata, step\n\nfrom steps.url_scraping_utils import get_all_pages\n\n@step\n\ndef url_scraper(\n\ndocs_url: str = \"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\",\n\nrepo_url: str =

{"anchor":"ight into the kinds of mistakes the LLM is making.Most notably, the scores we're currently getting are pretty high, so it would make sense to pass in harder questions and be more specific in the judging criteria. This will give us more room to improve as it is sure that the system is not perfect.\n\nWhile this evaluation approach serves as a solid foundation, it's worth noting that there are other frameworks available that can further enhance the evaluation process. Frameworks such as ragas, trulens, DeepEval, and UpTrain can be integrated with ZenML depending on your specific use-case and understanding of the underlying concepts. These frameworks, although potentially complex to set up and use, can provide more sophisticated evaluation capabilities as your project evolves and grows in complexity.\n\nWe now have a working evaluation of both the retrieval and generation evaluation components of our RAG pipeline.

{"anchor":"the GCP Secrets Manager as a secrets store backendThe GCP Secrets Store uses the ZenML GCP Service Connector under the hood to authenticate with the GCP Secrets Manager API. This means that you can use any of the authentication methods supported by the GCP Service Connector to authenticate with the GCP Secrets Manager API.\n\nThe minimum set of permissions that must be attached to the implicit or configured GCP credentials are as follows:\n\nsecretmanager.secrets.create for the target GCP project (i.e. no condition on the name prefix)\n\nsecretmanager.secrets.get, secretmanager.secrets.update, secretmanager.versions.access, secretmanager.versions.add and secretmanager.secrets.delete for the target GCP project and for secrets that have a name starting with zenml-\n\nThis can be achieved by creating two custom IAM roles and attaching them to the principal (e.g. user or service account) that will be used to access the GCP Secrets Manager API with a condition configured when attaching the second role to limit access to secrets with a name prefix of zenml-.

In order to run pipelines on Vertex AI, you need to have a GCP user account and\/or one or more GCP service accounts set up with proper permissions, depending on whether you wish to practice the principle of least privilege and distribute permissions across multiple service accounts.\n\nYou also have three different options to provide credentials to the orchestrator:\n\nuse the gcloud CLI to authenticate locally with GCP\n\nconfigure the orchestrator to use a service account key file to authenticate with GCP by setting the service_account_path parameter in the orchestrator configuration.\n\n(recommended) configure a GCP Service Connector with GCP credentials and then link the Vertex AI Orchestrator stack component to the Service Connector.\n\nThis section explains the different components and GCP resources involved in running a Vertex AI pipeline and what permissions they need, then provides instructions for three different configuration use-cases:\n\nuse the local gcloud CLI configured with your GCP user account, including the ability to schedule pipelines\n\nuse a GCP Service Connector and a single service account with all permissions, including the ability to

It assumes that the EKS cluster itself is already set up and configured with IAM access. For more information or tutorials for other clouds, check out the official Seldon Core installation instructions.\n\nConfigure EKS cluster access locally, e.g:\n\naws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name zenml-cluster --alias zenml-eks\n\nInstall Istio 1.5.0 (required for the latest Seldon Core version):\n\ncurl -L [https:\/\/istio.io\/downloadIstio](https:\/\/istio.io\/downloadIstio) | ISTIO_VERSION=1.5.0 sh -\n\ncd istio-1.5.0\/\n\nbin\/istioctl manifest apply --set profile=demo\n\nSet up an Istio gateway for Seldon Core:\n\ncurl https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/SeldonIO\/seldon-core\/master\/notebooks\/resources\/seldon-gateway.yaml | kubectl apply -f -\n\nInstall Seldon Core:\n\nhelm install seldon-core seldon-core-operator \\\n\n--repo https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/seldon-charts \\\n\n--set usageMetrics.enabled=true \\\n\n--set istio.enabled=true \\\n\n--namespace seldon-system\n\nTest that the installation is functional\n\nkubectl apply -f iris.yaml\n\nwith iris.yaml defined as follows:\n\napiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io\/v1\n\nkind: SeldonDeployment\n\nmetadata:\n\nname: iris-model\n\nnamespace: default\n\nspec:\n\nname: iris\n\npredictors:\n\ngraph:\n\nimplementation: SKLEARN_SERVER\n\nmodelUri: gs:\/\/seldon-models\/v1.14.0-dev\/sklearn\/iris\n\nname: classifier\n\nname: default\n\nreplicas: 1\n\nThen extract the URL where the model server exposes its prediction API:\n\nexport INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')\n\nAnd use curl to send a test prediction API request to the

{"anchor":"artifact_version(name_id_or_prefix=\"iris_dataset\")artifact.download_files(\"path\/to\/save.zip\")\n\nTake note that the path must have the .zip extension, as the artifact data will be saved as a zip file. Make sure to handle any exceptions that may arise from this operation.\n\nManaging artifacts not produced by ZenML pipelines\n\nSometimes, artifacts can be produced completely outside of ZenML. A good example of this is the predictions produced by a deployed model.\n\n# A model is deployed, running in a FastAPI container\n\n# Let's use the ZenML client to fetch the latest model and make predictions\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\nfrom zenml import save_artifact\n\n# Fetch the model from a registry or a previous pipeline\n\nmodel = ...\n\n# Let's make a prediction\n\nprediction = model.predict([[1, 1, 1, 1]])\n\n# We now store this prediction in ZenML as an artifact\n\n# This will create a new artifact version\n\nsave_artifact(prediction, name=\"iris_predictions\")\n\nYou can also load any artifact stored within ZenML using the load_artifact method:\n\n# Loads the latest version\n\nload_artifact(\"iris_predictions\")\n\nload_artifact is simply short-hand for the following Client call:\n\nfrom zenml.client import Client\n\nclient = Client()\n\nclient.get_artifact(\"iris_predictions\").load()\n\nEven if an artifact is created externally, it can be treated like any other artifact produced by ZenML steps - with all the functionalities described above!\n\nIt is also possible to use these functions inside your ZenML steps. However, it is usually cleaner to return the artifacts as outputs of your step to save them, or to use External Artifacts to load them instead.\n\nLogging metadata for an artifact\n\nOne of the most useful ways of interacting with artifacts in ZenML is the ability to associate metadata with them. As mentioned before, artifact metadata is an arbitrary dictionary of key-value pairs that are useful for understanding the nature of the data.","filename":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/user-guide\/starter-guide\/manage-artifacts","parent_section":"user-guide","url":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/user-guide\/starter-guide\/manage-artifacts","embedding":[-0.0315181054,0.0432814658,0.0217929501,0.018671928,0.0584325045,-0.0190302394,-0.0511508323,0.0354926065,0.0018301912,0.1001372859,-0.0105531383,-0.0561639778,0.0217301399,-0.0732728392,-0.0708811581,0.0527278073,-0.009646452,0.0475749522,-0.037606433,0.0086600157,0.011724594,-0.0410476178,0.0324529298,0.0409390926,-0.0263624359,0.0597884394,0.0142773064,0.017678136,0.0270316377,-0.0707776248,0.0742555857,0.0548116826,0.0293214042,-0.0130643388,0.0378384069,0.0660331696,-0.1171010658,-0.0148800649,-0.027484661,-0.0216581095,0.0662578717,0.0494423285,-0.0937010348,-0.0198985897,-0.0413110666,-0.0417736284,0.0985913277,-0.0425779037,0.0078122015,-0.0170183592,-0.0379623622,-0.0208037514,-0.0405783355,-0.0033955604,-0.0785308927,0.0185892228,0.0189301316,-0.0082347058,-0.1111052409,0.0211069733,0.0308629572,-0.0238769576,-0.1057716385,0.0035125578,-0.1117141992,0.0348841026,0.0313610099,-0.0000902152,0.123372592,-0.1007987335,-0.0246580243,0.069694154,-0.0003168689,0.0062275068,-0.0358016714,-0.0200400464,0.0700267106,0.012805826,-0.0415984355,-0.015683854,-0.0446267352,-0.0024406856,0.0998049676,0.0065933429,0.0209550746,-0.0267019458,-0.0512980297,0.0322430171,0.0642461926,-0.068977125,0.0488275811,-0.0308421813,-0.0359849371,0.0054676025,0.0477558114,0.0744433105,-0.0041333409,0.0261451006,0.0722466186,0.0064301644,0.0256882552,0.0348148979,-0.0060381107,-0.028269805,0.0440072119,0.022949839,0.0495702028,-0.0680065006,0.0058168271,-0.0228050873,0.0130911078,0.0813196823,0.0285087246,0.0540850908,0.0113040013,-0.0585582256,-0.1057417244,0.0056633963,-0.0516038127,0.0108376015,-0.0308192223,-0.0593523942,0.0048824823,0.0669699237,0.066084519,-0.0183909182,0.0178809594,-0.0856097639,0.1115076393,-0.0119940415,0.0231235474,-0.0489085615,0.0239635855,-0.0120752165,0.0088242805,-0.0403532907,0.0017437066,-0.0021714601,0.0121572763,0.1130773351,-0.0491043776,-0.0174150746,-0.0094105583,-0.0050970716,-0.0504068658,0.0672292858,0.0912753046,0.0579030886,-0.0134690376,-0.10072539,-0.1155047119,-0.0338232219,-0.0253941678,0.0277445819,-0.0161797069,-0.0368679315,-0.0303131305,0.0475826897,-0.0466841497,0.0356254019,0.0270849578,0.0818916783,-0.0276188515,0.0490827784,-0.0542513318,-0.006540658,-0.0621147491,-0.0025633096,0.1511085927,-0.0129239904,0.0105472282,0.0067015882,0.0583818927,-0.0001128792,-0.0522104427,-0.0289278291,0.119944185,-0.0183902718,0.0230526384,-0.0058289887,0.0346027501,0.0386608243,-0.044631768,-0.0824407414,-0.0307013188,-0.0434004441,0.0761390477,-0.0665490106,0.0633699819,-0.0254125539,-0.0855323374,0.1419179142,0.1358232498,0.0176646616,-0.003937589,0.0430609137,0.0237220805,-0.0340752602,-0.0259976052,0.0122521967,-0.0506634712,-0.0062778154,0.0410670973,-0.0112340273,-0.059311714,0.0351008102,-0.0024985655,0.025907686,-0.0406517647,-0.0146870436,-0.0020901209,-0.0433975123,0.0276281815,0.0506954193,-0.0016023321,0.0142439632,0.0283535663,-0.0435752682,-0.0163625218,0.0484509543,0.0507812388,-0.1109832004,-0.0408559404,1.162609023e-32,0.0530296788,-0.0261513665,0.0235229973,0.0371725336,0.0215049125,0.0006170052,0.0289646927,0.1173970774,0.0026888391,-0.0257995315,-0.0135895815,-0.0263876002,-0.0469092578,-0.1070327908,0.0424187407,-0.120637551,0.0627648979,-0.0164867286,0.0800899267,0.0257528611,-0.0760997832,-0.0378578156,-0.0012718134,-0.0566564202,0.0633938387,0.0343099795,0.003269928,-0.0342835598,-0.0633562133,0.0170115028,-0.0703709796,-0.0100814775,-0.0675938576,-0.0887131467,0.0141432667,-0.0733419061,0.0101286275,-0.0663949251,-0.0442888066,-0.0069107413,0.0003973307,-0.0181365386,-0.0331868194,0.0802558735,-0.018888386,-0.1121936291,-0.0206613764,-0.0295859966,0.0066280682,-0.054788813,0.0480197929,0.0109601449,-0.0403415523,-0.0671472847,0.0088787526,0.0392341092,0.044019416,0.0224615876,-0.0517011546,0.0696049407,0.031284757,0.068362385,-0.0451333933,0.005927505,0.0485519022,-0.0312083252,0.0443240367,0.0245565586,-0.1008703485,-0.0336831696,-0.0082720397,-0.0684330538,0.0273239985,0.0332825407,0.0356093757,-0.0872645602,-0.0280618239,0.0073452713,0.0819781572,0.0140871368,0.0384689569,-0.0847100765,0.0535648167,-0.0217639077,-0.0115024615,-0.0637106523,-0.0464529619,-0.0914085582,0.0352080464,-0.0207372494,0.0433675908,0.0173182636,-0.0216123816,-0.0155250961,0.0255191717,5.235999197e-32,0.011996489,0.0592223108,-0.0302199833,0.0316152833,0.0201606508,0.0316612385,-0.0560728721,0.0587996654,0.0359459035,-0.0770999342,0.0585915707,-0.0555022433,0.0233386867,0.101427123,0.0513040796,0.0215703286,0.0747489259,0.1299173832,-0.0053035337,-0.0793898255,0.052234333,0.0296905022,0.155921042,-0.050824862,0.0929907113,-0.0092641842,-0.0135055529,0.0727179199,0.0070339544,0.0362670794,-0.0079014534,-0.0172828585,0.079572618,-0.012501657,0.0428147279,0.0155817308,0.0364831686,0.0191

{"anchor":"An end-to-end project\n\nPut your new knowledge in action with an end-to-end project\n\nThat was awesome! We learned so many advanced MLOps production concepts:\n\nThe value of deploying ZenML\n\nAbstracting infrastructure configuration into stacks\n\nConnecting remote storage\n\nOrchestrating on the cloud\n\nConfiguring the pipeline to scale compute\n\nConnecting a git repository\n\nWe will now combine all of these concepts into an end-to-end MLOps project powered by ZenML.\n\nGet started\n\nStart with a fresh virtual environment with no dependencies. Then let's install our dependencies:\n\npip install \"zenml[templates,server]\" notebook\n\nzenml integration install sklearn -y\n\nWe will then use ZenML templates to help us get the code we need for the project:\n\nmkdir zenml_batch_e2e\n\ncd zenml_batch_e2e\n\nzenml init --template e2e_batch --template-with-defaults\n\n# Just in case, we install the requirements again\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nThe e2e template is also available as a ZenML example. You can clone it:\n\ngit clone --depth 1 git@github.com:zenml-io\/zenml.git\n\ncd zenml\/examples\/e2e\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nzenml init\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nThe e2e project is a comprehensive project template to cover major use cases of ZenML: a collection of steps and pipelines and, to top it all off, a simple but useful CLI. It showcases the core ZenML concepts for supervised ML with batch predictions. It builds on top of the starter project with more advanced concepts.\n\nAs you progress through the e2e batch template, try running the pipelines on a remote cloud stack on a tracked git repository to practice some of the concepts we have learned in this guide.\n\nAt the end, don't forget to share the ZenML e2e template with your colleagues and see how they react!\n\nConclusion and next

When MFA is enabled, the AWS CLI generates temporary credentials that are valid for a limited time. These temporary credentials cannot be used by the ZenML AWS Service Connector, as it requires long-lived credentials to authenticate and access AWS resources.\n\nTo use the AWS Service Connector with ZenML, you will need to use a different AWS CLI profile that does not have MFA enabled. You can do this by setting the AWS_PROFILE environment variable to the name of the profile you want to use before running the ZenML CLI commands.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe AWS Service Connector is part of the AWS ZenML integration. You can either install the entire integration or use a PyPI extra to install it independently of the integration:\n\npip install \"zenml[connectors-aws]\" installs only prerequisites for the AWS Service Connector Type\n\nzenml integration install aws installs the entire AWS ZenML integration\n\nIt is not required to install and set up the AWS CLI on your local machine to use the AWS Service Connector to link Stack Components to AWS resources and services. However, it is recommended to do so if you are looking for a quick setup that includes using the auto-configuration Service Connector features.\n\nThe auto-configuration examples in this page rely on the AWS CLI being installed and already configured with valid credentials of one type or another.

{"anchor":"Specify pip dependencies and apt packages\n\nThe configuration for specifying pip and apt dependencies only works in the remote pipeline case, and is disregarded for local pipelines (i.e. pipelines that run locally without having to build a Docker image).\n\nWhen a pipeline is run with a remote orchestrator a Dockerfile is dynamically generated at runtime. It is then used to build the Docker image using the image builder component of your stack.\n\nBy default, ZenML automatically installs all packages required by your active ZenML stack.

{"anchor":"multiple times to pass in multiple configurations.Interactive stack deployment\n\nIf you would like to be guided through the deployment process, you can use the zenml stack deploy command with the --interactive flag. You will still need to provide the provider, name and region options as described above but for the rest, you will get prompts in the CLI as to which components you would like to deploy. For example, using GCP as the provider you might type:\n\nzenml stack deploy -p gcp -n my_new_stack -r us-east1 --interactive\n\nDisplaying Terraform outputs for stacks deployed with mlstacks\n\nIf you want to view any of the Terraform-generated outputs for a stack deployed with mlstacks, you can do so with the following command:\n\nzenml stack describe -o <STACK_NAME>\n\nThis will print any available outputs to the console if you have deployed a stack with mlstacks via ZenML.\n\nDeleting \/ destroying resources\n\n\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Once you're done running your pipelines, there's only a single command you need to execute that will take care of cleaning up all the resources that you had created on your cloud.\n\nzenml stack destroy <STACK_NAME>\n\nThis will offer you the option to delete the underlying stack specifications and state files as well. You can also choose to delete the stack from your ZenML server.\n\nPreviousDeploy a stack component\n\nNextReference secrets in stack configuration\n\nLast updated 19 days

{"anchor":"\/]{cluster-name}\n\nAKS cluster name: {cluster-name}Given that the AKS cluster name is unique within a resource group, the resource group name may be included in the resource name to avoid ambiguity. If a resource group is configured in the connector, the resource group name in the resource name must match the configured resource group. If no resource group is configured in the connector and a resource group name is not included in the resource name, the connector will attempt to find the AKS cluster in any resource group.\n\nIf a resource group is configured in the connector, only AKS clusters in that resource group will be accessible.\n\nACR container registry\n\nAllows Stack Components to access one or more ACR registries as a standard Docker registry resource. When used by Stack Components, they are provided a pre-authenticated python-docker client instance.\n\nThe configured credentials must have at least the following Azure IAM permissions associated with the ACR registries that the connector will be allowed to access:\n\nallow access to pull and push images (e.g. the AcrPull and AcrPush roles)\n\nallow access to list registries (e.g. the Contributor role)\n\nIf set, the resource name must identify an ACR registry using one of the following formats:\n\nACR registry URI (canonical resource name): [https:\/\/]{registry-name}.azurecr.io\n\nACR registry name: {registry-name}\n\nIf a resource group is configured in the connector, only ACR registries in that resource group will be accessible.\n\nIf an authentication method other than the Azure service principal is used for authentication, the admin account must be enabled for the registry, otherwise, clients will not be able to authenticate to the registry.

If you don't have a repository yet, take a look at the deployment section.\n\nOn the top, click the copy button to copy the full repository URL.\n\nInfrastructure Deployment\n\nA GCP Container Registry can be deployed directly from the ZenML CLI:\n\nzenml container-registry deploy gcp_container_registry --flavor=gcp --provider=gcp ...\n\nYou can pass other configurations specific to the stack components as key-value arguments. If you don't provide a name, a random one is generated for you. For more information about how to work use the CLI for this, please refer to the dedicated documentation section.\n\nHow to use it\n\nTo use the GCP container registry, we need:\n\nDocker installed and running.\n\nThe registry URI. Check out the previous section on the URI format and how to get the URI for your registry.\n\nWe can then register the container registry and use it in our active stack:\n\nzenml container-registry register <NAME> \\\n\n--flavor=gcp \\\n\n--uri=<REGISTRY_URI>\n\n# Add the container registry to the active stack\n\nzenml stack update -c <NAME>\n\nYou also need to set up authentication required to log in to the container registry.\n\nAuthentication Methods\n\nIntegrating and using a GCP Container Registry in your pipelines is not possible without employing some form of authentication. If you're looking for a quick way to get started locally, you can use the Local Authentication method. However, the recommended way to authenticate to the GCP cloud platform is through a GCP Service Connector. This is particularly useful if you are configuring ZenML stacks that combine the GCP Container Registry with other remote stack components also running in

{"anchor":"ents locally!\n\nRunning a pipeline on a cloud stackNow that we have our remote artifact store registered, we can register a new stack with it, just like we did in the previous chapter:\n\nzenml stack register local_with_remote_storage -o default -a cloud_artifact_store\n\nNow, using the code from the previous chapter, we run a training pipeline:\n\nSet our local_with_remote_storage stack active:\n\nzenml stack set local_with_remote_storage\n\nLet us continue with the example from the previous page and run the training pipeline:\n\npython run.py --training-pipeline\n\nWhen you run that pipeline, ZenML will automatically store the artifacts in the specified remote storage, ensuring that they are preserved and accessible for future runs and by your team members. You can ask your colleagues to connect to the same ZenML server, and you will notice that if they run the same pipeline, the pipeline would be partially cached, even if they have not run the pipeline themselves before.\n\nYou can list your artifact versions as follows:\n\n# This will give you the artifacts from the last 15 minutes\n\nzenml artifact version list --created=\"gte:$(date -d '15 minutes ago' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\"\n\nThe ZenML Cloud features an Artifact Control Plane to visualize artifact versions:\n\nYou will notice above that some artifacts are stored locally, while others are stored in a remote storage location.\n\nBy connecting remote storage, you're taking a significant step towards building a collaborative and scalable MLOps workflow.

you.","filename":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/how-to\/auth-management\/best-security-practices","parent_section":"how-to","url":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/how-to\/auth-management\/best-security-practices","embedding":[-0.0959358364,-0.0827467889,-0.0211586449,0.0814327076,0.0183846243,-0.0538501851,0.0182482544,0.0034759857,-0.0289929602,0.1045663953,0.0977194831,-0.0650984645,0.0421406776,0.0840582848,-0.0629508942,0.0652548969,-0.008920785,0.0226196013,-0.0090884361,0.0223584734,0.0080156289,-0.0039280853,0.0477989428,0.021450229,0.0041128905,-0.0270184577,-0.05473575,0.0095053082,0.0682834089,-0.0140784401,-0.0153977098,-0.0255295057,0.0162004493,-0.0284506977,0.0387916341,0.0267233718,0.0187253002,-0.0943439975,-0.0106821246,-0.0163667407,0.0289943013,0.0181984473,-0.066035293,0.0775847137,-0.0665033683,-0.0400469266,-0.0137601374,0.0302214436,0.0126889106,-0.0852093548,-0.0370926782,0.0049277805,-0.0755065382,-0.0665647313,-0.0129331583,-0.0859915018,0.0114012873,0.041527275,-0.033984676,0.0315129608,0.0460353307,-0.0004126539,-0.0455539711,-0.0003178908,-0.0409961194,-0.0513471998,-0.1446810514,-0.0466864668,0.0214313529,0.0274650604,-0.1091740429,0.0114398459,-0.0974582061,0.0766991898,-0.0149128148,-0.0237355046,0.1259180903,0.0179468673,-0.0491409786,-0.0382943153,-0.1299566925,-0.0004440335,0.0528606288,0.0299801994,0.008288105,0.010171229,-0.0310660433,0.0075522228,0.0895230547,-0.0372569077,0.0499555022,0.022349691,-0.011189661,0.0759860724,0.0146457274,0.066596441,0.0298744012,-0.0130910259,0.0086590694,0.0993682146,-0.0065835174,-0.038533885,-0.0381607711,-0.0681438521,-0.0584967248,0.0426129028,-0.0377124548,-0.0512252934,0.1219298542,0.0169450343,-0.0570159368,0.0083349831,0.0749346465,0.0585274659,0.0001840613,0.0409931801,-0.0881755725,-0.0142746512,-0.0250660647,0.0375683457,0.101945959,-0.0018259039,0.0054620667,-0.009477024,0.0226465017,-0.0524325147,0.1192114279,-0.0407577865,0.101385802,-0.0094310706,0.0095669022,-0.0486058518,0.083189413,0.0764213875,0.0109689478,-0.0286887772,-0.0362538435,0.0057640886,-0.0291149486,-0.066614002,-0.0422492661,0.0603832528,-0.0246697944,-0.028339453,-0.0070659094,-0.0157048851,0.0538759083,0.0305777024,0.0025876795,-0.0020155297,0.0052301162,0.0275687519,0.0149979591,0.1080977917,0.0387441814,0.0887010917,0.0180497803,0.0139936469,0.013689897,-0.0053109517,0.0392256342,0.0188185219,0.0361347012,0.0182208754,-0.0154207284,-0.0153597621,-0.0297323465,0.0374886617,0.0123480028,0.0288030747,-0.0501351319,-0.0018547546,-0.0009014269,0.0493616909,-0.0696203038,0.0654247105,0.028359184,-0.0275293738,0.0421720706,-0.0157940052,-0.0063265692,0.0174130276,-0.0145579558,-0.0481933728,0.0024254054,-0.0053611593,-0.0111599304,0.0304570645,0.0708271042,-0.0230763778,0.0548177548,0.0054548415,0.1358587146,-0.0527889766,0.0438355021,-0.0511582121,0.088480711,0.0058908178,-0.0212646555,0.103703998,-0.0454946943,0.0354667939,0.0304528233,0.0047847116,-0.083996214,-0.0710767433,0.010011889,0.0321956538,-0.0287894588,-0.043781843,-0.0549815744,-0.0072071133,0.0595450737,-0.0312862694,-0.0084621608,0.0397736989,-0.0483315215,-0.0557331815,-0.0130715258,-0.0972126499,-0.0419484489,-0.0557369217,0.0287645329,1.58224111e-32,-0.0470400676,0.1016124785,-0.0092049502,-0.05678932,-0.0150969652,-0.0803562999,0.0648990273,0.0433934666,0.0709861293,0.009683555,-0.0192612931,-0.0308303107,-0.0136592267,-0.0489263758,0.0332951918,-0.0656602457,-0.0154116964,-0.0520350188,0.0788698643,0.0742319599,-0.0583723485,0.0627776086,-0.0082355645,0.0186683554,-0.0486783609,0.0005367356,-0.06470339,-0.0398044363,-0.056068711,-0.027076304,-0.0547281168,0.0796658397,-0.068662405,0.0324763954,0.0323803723,-0.0014799226,-0.014960669,-0.021730246,-0.0581196845,-0.046971187,0.0649116486,0.0021740785,-0.0348306336,0.0357990153,-0.0592536815,-0.0305234566,-0.0551811084,-0.0424176529,-0.0335233063,-0.0264304392,0.0712341666,-0.1232496649,0.0911013857,-0.011835576,0.0738116577,0.0103230774,0.0101731448,0.0359579399,0.055772312,-0.0240853485,0.05622264,0.0450644083,0.0154104671,-0.0838104934,0.059840437,0.0515820421,-0.0353655592,0.074008815,0.0934170559,-0.0559038743,-0.082675837,0.0072769644,0.0232966971,-0.0008192977,0.0544113666,0.0743506104,-0.0462457947,-0.0137342745,0.0376358852,0.0445067026,-0.0832675621,-0.0689681396,-0.0007558495,0.0036792716,-0.0742193162,-0.0945836157,0.0398118943,0.0385652743,-0.0038681806,0.0452090092,-0.0150297787,-0.0199296195,0.0312100928,0.156997323,0.1170858443,7.414544641e-32,-0.035936527,-0.0546625741,-0.0287118685,-0.0260674991,0.0948081315,0.0230194163,-0.0208712108,-0.0136853158,0.0077272891,0.005349353,0.0707392618,-0.0446422882,-0.0421638526,0.0265213009,0.0071783438,0.0043879123,-0.1249951273,0.0118237948,0.0056926827,-0.1123881266,-0.0066457642,0.0501852706,-0.0147838024,-0.031766966,-0.0394348241,-0.0279422775,-0.0167453103,0.0605188645,-0.0463288911,-0.0023131594,-0.0452766754,-0.0374919176,0.0552318357,-0.073841691,-0.0381133817,0.0664738119,-0.0559798852,0.042

{"anchor":"AzureML\n\nExecuting individual steps in AzureML.\n\nAzureML offers specialized compute instances to run your training jobs and has a comprehensive UI to track and manage your models and logs. ZenML's AzureML step operator allows you to submit individual steps to be run on AzureML compute instances.\n\nWhen to use it\n\nYou should use the AzureML step operator if:\n\none or more steps of your pipeline require computing resources (CPU, GPU, memory) that are not provided by your orchestrator.\n\nyou have access to AzureML. If you're using a different cloud provider, take a look at the SageMaker or Vertex step operators.\n\nHow to deploy it\n\nCreate a Machine learning resource on Azure .\n\nOnce your resource is created, you can head over to the Azure Machine Learning Studio and create a compute cluster to run your pipelines.\n\nCreate an environment for your pipelines. Follow this guide to set one up.\n\n(Optional) Create a Service Principal for authentication. This is required if you intend to run your pipelines with a remote orchestrator.\n\nHow to use it\n\nTo use the AzureML step operator, we need:\n\nThe ZenML azure integration installed. If you haven't done so, runCopyzenml integration install azure\n\nAn AzureML compute cluster and environment. See the deployment section for detailed instructions.\n\nA remote artifact store as part of your stack. This is needed so that both your orchestration environment and AzureML can read and write step artifacts. Check out the documentation page of the artifact store you want to use for more information on how to set that up and configure authentication for it.\n\nWe can then register the step operator and use

Depending on whether you have a Kubernetes (using Helm or zenml deploy) or a Docker deployment, you can view the logs in different ways.\n\nIf you are using Kubernetes, you can view the logs of the ZenML server using the following method:\n\nCheck all pods that are running your ZenML deployment.\n\nkubectl -n <KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE> get pods\n\nIf you see that the pods aren't running, you can use the command below to get the logs for all pods at once.\n\nkubectl -n <KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE> logs -l app.kubernetes.io\/name=zenml\n\nNote that the error can either be from the zenml-db-init container that connects to the MySQL database or from the zenml container that runs the server code. If the get pods command shows that the pod is failing in the Init state then use zenml-db-init as the container name, otherwise use zenml.\n\nkubectl -n <KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE> logs -l app.kubernetes.io\/name=zenml -c <CONTAINER_NAME>\n\nYou can also use the --tail flag to limit the number of lines to show or the --follow flag to follow the logs in real-time.\n\nIf you are using Docker, you can view the logs of the ZenML server using the following method:\n\nIf you used the zenml up --docker CLI command to deploy the Docker ZenML server, you can check the logs with the

{"anchor":" targeted improvements to the retrieval component.To wrap up, the retrieval evaluation process we've walked through - from manual spot-checking with carefully crafted queries to automated testing with synthetic question-document pairs - has provided a solid baseline understanding of our retrieval component's performance. The failure rates of 20% on our handpicked test cases and 16% on a larger sample of generated queries highlight clear room for improvement, but also validate that our semantic search is generally pointing in the right direction.\n\nGoing forward, we have a rich set of options to refine and upgrade our evaluation approach. Generating a more diverse array of test questions, leveraging semantic similarity metrics for a nuanced view beyond binary success\/failure, performing comparative evaluations of different retrieval techniques, and conducting deep error analysis on failure cases - all of these avenues promise to yield valuable insights. As our RAG pipeline grows to handle more complex and wide-ranging queries, continued investment in comprehensive retrieval evaluation will be essential to ensure we're always surfacing the most relevant information.\n\nBefore we start working to improve or tweak our retrieval based on these evaluation results, let's shift gears and look at how we can evaluate the generation component of our RAG pipeline. Assessing the quality of the final answers produced by the system is equally crucial to gauging the effectiveness of our retrieval.","filename":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/v\/docs\/user-guide\/llmops-guide\/evaluation\/retrieval","parent_section":"user-guide","url":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/v\/docs\/user-guide\/llmops-guide\/evaluation\/retrieval","embedding":[0.0250073615,-0.001211897,-0.0240240339,0.0732072219,-0.024030976,0.0822890326,-0.0951880589,0.0303803086,-0.0353709608,-0.0484205037,-0.0260042977,-0.0525211021,-0.0014383921,-0.0625704825,-0.0112685338,-0.058585126,0.120465748,-0.001334473,-0.0022237306,0.0181479529,-0.0335507095,-0.0587067008,0.1079000011,-0.0851130038,-0.0973235741,-0.0598110594,-0.0726120695,0.0179955363,0.0035529893,-0.0701979175,0.0502061173,0.1216810048,0.0665352494,0.0883703232,-0.0321872644,-0.0574164353,0.0211928245,0.0237036124,0.0498251878,-0.0200632866,0.0350926332,-0.0786149278,-0.0184376277,0.0735267922,-0.0225207135,0.0290233158,-0.0204000603,-0.017545877,-0.0408904515,-0.0601865128,-0.0657751709,-0.0380416103,0.0294649657,0.044574175,-0.0883870944,-0.0261345208,0.0385742523,-0.0768908933,-0.0274269078,-0.0418551341,0.0530940779,0.0800085068,-0.0292783529,-0.0342283659,-0.0008116039,-0.0500914194,-0.03575591,-0.0358327217,0.023853479,-0.0649956316,0.0466644056,0.0163831376,-0.0104236407,0.0571853481,-0.0214884728,0.0388046987,-0.014458105,-0.0765683427,0.0829720795,-0.0970944539,0.0257224981,-0.0032949133,-0.0406570397,-0.0864405781,-0.0470951535,-0.0379418433,0.0102581447,-0.1054695994,-0.0855504274,0.064050138,0.0121893222,-0.052690547,0.0580005385,-0.0228443071,-0.016434174,0.0859378353,0.0327744558,-0.011640517,0.0940069407,0.0226916131,0.0171607435,0.0427939966,-0.0007593731,-0.0466032699,-0.0211507156,0.0175050646,0.0427452065,-0.0878392458,-0.0263481159,-0.053995382,0.0334734619,0.0058669765,-0.0421913788,-0.0471649766,-0.0496808589,0.021974517,0.0584703162,0.0557033196,-0.0357974395,0.045026511,0.0023182607,-0.0448101349,0.0062544695,0.0221052766,0.0430036969,0.0431321599,-0.0870712325,0.0088422876,0.0730143189,0.0429961607,0.0760674849,0.0800138861,-0.0444619507,-0.0121210283,-0.0045206277,0.03720963,-0.0373819396,-0.034644559,-0.0316000171,0.0923011899,-0.0437802076,0.0573661886,-0.031155739,0.0264826007,-0.0673534796,0.1049035639,-0.1119465008,-0.0497917198,0.0137314191,-0.0523596406,0.0175919011,-0.0435633175,0.0526978597,0.0288152825,0.0297032706,0.0692139268,-0.0299865231,-0.0146203274,-0.0296762139,-0.0368169434,0.0172028616,0.0646471828,-0.0600975081,-0.0089695249,-0.0034925723,0.003824441,-0.0183441695,0.0147418454,-0.1477465034,-0.0100186998,0.1396978796,0.029833544,0.0194270778,-0.0332063399,-0.0508324578,0.050199952,-0.0202511866,-0.0079666907,0.0596621893,0.0134910066,0.0147098554,0.003897089,0.0018883138,0.0085745146,-0.0048813387,-0.0039216075,-0.0163787268,-0.0115356678,0.0459781662,0.0835377425,0.0322533473,-0.0123698898,-0.0012523459,0.0132071953,-0.0184548926,-0.0034106609,0.0570163094,0.011992435,-0.0318577029,0.0287131853,0.0336131677,-0.0846140906,0.0130371163,-0.0139923394,0.0334049053,-0.0195063259,0.0823506117,-0.1085850447,-0.0049978574,-0.017125288,-0.009017935,-0.0047808383,-0.0122016538,-0.0161544289,0.0269196387,-0.0511557423,0.066145964,-0.0340079665,-0.0157710481,0.0286439788,-0.0295744799,-0.0463620424,0.0833836049,1.239759086e-33,0.0143614309,-0.0120939165,-0.085999079,0.0969039872,0.0173885133,-0.0447026603,0.023970658,-0.0225037187,0.0405463874,-0.001658758,0.0054131527,-0.0588480532,-0.0218437985,-0.0116163446,-0.1494024992,0.0461385213,-0.0115242191,0.0370277092,0.1131398901,0.0202604253,0.0933570862,0.0610798001,-0.1094801649,0.06030019,-0.0343212262,-0.0162453037,0.133811295,-0.0496666841,-0.0269521177,0.0108888969,-0.0685535371,-0.0747532919,-0.0777354091,0.0713537484,0.0234542545,0.0083260536,0.0457026064,-0.1230624989,0.0335992947,-0.0069629285,0.0629231408,0.0395282805,-0.0954291373,-0.0311153606,-0.0660570487,0.035522785,-0.0648871064,0.0467959605,0.0978014097,0.0097643845,0.0440937169,0.0532503463,-0.0656338558,-0.0447360463,0.0280499049,0.0440346785,0.0012633887,-0.0526595823,-0.0149506815,0.0034145005,-0.1031106636,0.0530151241,-0.0109580131,0.0205748249,0.0186510906,-0.0124163255,0.0638791099,-0.0153972665,-0.047719989,0.0025937562,-0.0756007433,-0.0825130567,0.0217182636,-0.0559528954,-0.0015668146,0.0389518254,0.0420012288,0.0215612575,-0.0546468683,0.0254153982,0.0108763371,0.0511772744,-0.0165423937,0.0349169075,0.0087549342,0.0856745094,0.0295878649,0.0981598496,-0.0262394939,-0.0285403114,0.0009520084,-0.0344521217,-0.0014973964,0.0129508767,-0.0690125301,6.355431871e-32,-0.0223351512,0.1138197482,-0.0743240789,0.0490214676,-0.0156228691,-0.0484927185,-0.0487302952,0.0762346163,-0.0459562726,0.0344950631,0.0049245167,-0.0348142795,-0.0353130884,0.0073033543,0.0393336676,0.0199874025,0.0289664529,0.0894038901,-0.0634906217,-0.0547005646,0.0303403679,0.0434301123,0.0498889349,-0.0294234399,0.0472967923,0.0664646402,0.0312160682,0.0372184105,0.0436678156,-0.0548347607,0.0791000202,0.0434470326,0.0011877741,0.0093577933,0.01479418

{"anchor":" to install and configure the AWS CLI on your hostyou don't need to care about enabling your other stack components (orchestrators, step operators, and model deployers) to have access to the artifact store through IAM roles and policies\n\nyou can combine the S3 artifact store with other stack components that are not running in AWS\n\nNote: When you create the IAM user for your AWS access key, please remember to grant the created IAM user permissions to read and write to your S3 bucket (i.e. at a minimum: s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject, s3:ListBucket, s3:DeleteObject)\n\nAfter having set up the IAM user and generated the access key, as described in the AWS documentation, you can register the S3 Artifact Store as follows:\n\n# Store the AWS access key in a ZenML secret\n\nzenml secret create s3_secret \\\n\n--aws_access_key_id='<YOUR_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID>' \\\n\n--aws_secret_access_key='<YOUR_S3_SECRET_KEY>'\n\n# Register the S3 artifact-store and reference the ZenML secret\n\nzenml artifact-store register s3_store -f s3 \\\n\n--path='s3:\/\/your-bucket' \\\n\n--authentication_secret=s3_secret\n\n# Register and set a stack with the new artifact store\n\nzenml stack register custom_stack -a s3_store ... --set\n\nAdvanced Configuration\n\nThe S3 Artifact Store accepts a range of advanced configuration options that can be used to further customize how ZenML connects to the S3 storage service that you are using. These are accessible via the client_kwargs, config_kwargs and s3_additional_kwargs configuration attributes and are passed transparently to the underlying S3Fs library:\n\nclient_kwargs: arguments that will be transparently passed to the botocore client . You can use it to configure parameters like endpoint_url and region_name when connecting to an S3-compatible endpoint (e.g. Minio).\n\nconfig_kwargs: advanced parameters passed to botocore.client.Config.\n\ns3_additional_kwargs: advanced parameters that are used when calling S3 API, typically used for things like ServerSideEncryption and ACL.","filename":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/v\/docs\/stack-components\/artifact-stores\/s3","parent_section":"stack-components","url":"https:\/\/docs.zenml.io\/v\/docs\/stack-components\/artifact-stores\/s3","embedding":[-0.0230794623,-0.0258863457,0.0024603389,-0.0861823261,0.0814365894,-0.058037784,-0.0506304689,-0.065294981,0.0283421688,0.1005954146,0.005596994,-0.1129319072,0.0182702001,-0.017760396,0.1287251264,0.0204485655,-0.0169450082,0.0520002283,-0.0841045454,-0.0276973508,-0.0096852062,0.0517305024,-0.0513943359,-0.0086667985,-0.0404398479,-0.0017814963,0.0000725966,0.0337537788,0.0599032976,0.0297935959,0.0004179508,-0.0521173701,0.0435663275,-0.0973611474,-0.0060081659,0.0723927543,0.0073041138,-0.0159459393,-0.0357856974,-0.1001954898,-0.0314101316,0.0750264227,0.0237234142,-0.0269351564,0.015183582,0.0148673514,0.0341604538,-0.0766801015,-0.0596330613,-0.0266719013,-0.0055373264,0.0105266077,0.0564188398,-0.0619763359,-0.064421773,0.0885442421,-0.035660509,0.0521058738,-0.1125371978,-0.1164658442,0.0383948684,-0.0409017019,-0.0220579766,-0.0149034057,-0.0488659926,0.0640736446,0.0145249283,-0.0031490324,0.0791965872,-0.0844853073,0.0293949097,0.0060189958,-0.0545655079,0.0427018739,0.0371143036,-0.0231548529,0.1294167042,-0.0011076784,0.0193682462,-0.0236939937,0.0117467307,-0.0095412489,0.0207107775,0.0784334615,-0.0570133068,0.0250221808,0.0053717135,-0.0699698925,0.0367806852,-0.0058509274,0.0026832165,-0.088403672,-0.0105704293,-0.1266126633,0.0088261114,-0.0247230064,-0.081555143,-0.0185341239,0.0067541632,-0.0252137221,-0.00467081,-0.0284355693,-0.020477701,0.0028541212,0.0005265764,0.0120219048,-0.054653462,0.0230173264,0.0309899356,0.0161918532,-0.0006613609,0.0068232361,-0.0005961407,-0.0401198007,0.0305241942,0.0599646084,-0.0359510072,0.0253306739,0.0238039754,-0.0520266183,-0.0146399429,-0.0163434278,0.0015829925,0.0103093339,0.0701261461,0.0954279155,0.0398732498,0.0034090311,0.044668179,0.003214268,-0.0819967017,-0.0304146484,-0.040192835,-0.0734397918,-0.0785549283,0.0055917641,0.0034273542,-0.0533749573,0.0666985288,0.0418208838,-0.0019470738,-0.0235071983,-0.0018614464,-0.0044601946,0.0912754014,-0.0223126058,0.0667222664,0.0100157112,-0.0386827998,-0.0961223766,-0.0845383629,-0.0290581919,0.0820660889,0.0067350264,0.0003584419,0.0045411186,-0.0647236034,-0.0312642679,0.000083596,0.0299404822,0.0161909331,0.0333798937,-0.1083097905,0.0318841301,-0.0747822002,0.0025064033,-0.0493578129,0.0243035834,-0.0519399345,0.0723900348,0.03020541,-0.0095045483,-0.0638172626,0.0461522155,0.0321904905,-0.0070626466,0.0694013685,0.0412714295,-0.0642265081,-0.0531525947,0.0897184536,-0.0402349718,0.0403222814,0.0286853164,-0.021648176,0.0476968549,-0.0563873872,0.0029890926,-0.0509611145,0.0047962372,-0.0282269064,0.1307730079,0.0588379838,0.042470891,-0.0767024681,-0.0651580021,-0.0404834785,-0.0406252146,-0.0128819421,0.0697798878,0.0328040719,0.0470304675,-0.0045643887,0.0862924755,-0.0183792096,0.1276415586,0.0710370317,0.0565756187,-0.0305516701,0.0072238208,0.1488327831,-0.0023425093,-0.0065198834,0.0016798503,-0.0462544709,0.0678458214,0.0811974555,-0.0191452261,-0.050582204,0.0335460529,0.0616879128,0.0556867048,-0.0783675089,1.807259014e-33,0.0729354694,-0.0452831648,0.0032065418,-0.0858976468,0.0330581404,-0.0123258838,0.0534116365,-0.0098263007,0.0257998947,0.0034487827,-0.0391045883,0.0537649393,0.0402981527,-0.0617912672,0.0046592751,-0.0537008345,-0.0820655227,-0.0251946822,0.0912842453,0.0086596636,0.0001813068,-0.0681694075,0.0051527969,-0.0781017989,-0.0225512385,-0.0081259618,-0.0303946715,-0.0156083321,-0.0454129949,0.0325737707,-0.0997737944,0.012476177,-0.1057321951,-0.0913458988,0.0850733444,-0.0641302392,-0.0786671713,-0.0085207727,-0.1148500592,-0.0194362234,0.0428843014,-0.0245641004,0.0158541948,0.0109841358,-0.0093121305,0.016547367,0.0240393486,0.0079823285,-0.0243666582,-0.032442838,-0.0556590557,-0.0245201364,-0.0119099952,-0.0065940791,0.0522547066,0.0169083402,0.0658855364,0.0544728637,0.0073967008,0.0515617095,-0.0180579443,0.0187904779,-0.007939213,0.0090000471,0.045789782,-0.031110784,-0.0465053432,-0.0008093284,-0.1334386468,0.0452676564,0.0465395935,-0.1445911527,0.0215217397,-0.007602897,-0.0058526401,-0.0302039366,-0.0208093692,0.0028803751,0.0573288016,-0.0446335897,0.0139228655,-0.0336082391,-0.0073486674,0.0424869172,0.0695004463,0.0007948718,0.0556060746,0.0312449839,0.0009343561,0.0480071418,0.0491109528,-0.0745054111,-0.0026691179,-0.0634967163,-0.0248295031,6.129359622e-32,-0.0371309146,0.0701656491,-0.020959951,-0.0048591052,-0.0485774688,-0.0153376143,-0.0222765859,0.0324723721,0.0534265041,0.0198011771,0.033977624,-0.040371649,-0.0121334149,0.0078478176,-0.0194191653,0.0296594389,0.02015635,0.064824678,0.0275650322,-0.0395633802,0.0493154228,0.0396655761,0.1698820144,0.0089574642,0.0044395556,-0.0473156683,0.0076058963,-0.0295660123,0.0640085042,0.0863262266,0.0007545407,0.0245710574,0.0111945141,0.0366713479,-0.0281616934,-0.0638076589,-0.0006

{"anchor":"Project templates\n\nRocketstart your ZenML journey!\n\nWhat would you need to get a quick understanding of the ZenML framework and start building your ML pipelines? The answer is one of ZenML project templates to cover major use cases of ZenML: a collection of steps and pipelines and, to top it all off, a simple but useful CLI. This is exactly what the ZenML templates are all about!\n\nList of available project templates\n\nProject Template [Short name] Tags Description Starter template [ starter ] basic scikit-learn All the basic ML ingredients you need to get you started with ZenML: parameterized steps, a model training pipeline, a flexible configuration and a simple CLI. All created around a representative and versatile model training use-case implemented with the scikit-learn library. E2E Training with Batch Predictions [ e2e_batch ] etl hp-tuning model-promotion drift-detection batch-prediction scikit-learn This project template is a good starting point for anyone starting with ZenML. It consists of two pipelines with the following high-level steps: load, split, and preprocess data; run HP tuning; train and evaluate model performance; promote model to production; detect data drift; run batch inference. NLP Training Pipeline [ nlp ] nlp hp-tuning model-promotion training pytorch gradio huggingface This project template is a simple NLP training pipeline that walks through tokenization, training, HP tuning, evaluation and deployment for a BERT or GPT-2 based model and testing locally it with gradio\n\nDo you have a personal project powered by ZenML that you would like to see here?

{"anchor":"e helm chart\n\ncd src\/zenml\/zen_server\/deploy\/helm\/Simply reuse the custom-values.yaml file that you used during the previous installation or upgrade. If you don't have it handy, you can extract the values from the ZenML Helm deployment using the following command:Copyhelm -n <namespace> get values zenml-server > custom-values.yaml\n\nUpgrade the release using your modified values file. Make sure you are in the directory that hosts the helm chart:Copyhelm -n <namespace> upgrade zenml-server . -f custom-values.yaml\n\nIt is not recommended to change the container image tag in the Helm chart to custom values, since every Helm chart version is tested to work only with the default image tag. However, if you know what you're doing you can change the zenml.image.tag value in your custom-values.yaml file to the desired ZenML version (e.g. 0.32.0).\n\nDowngrading the server to an older

You can create a key for this service account and download it to your local machine (e.g. in a connectors-vertex-ai-workload.json file).\n\nWith all the service accounts and the key ready, we can register the GCP Service Connector and Vertex AI orchestrator as follows:\n\nzenml service-connector register <CONNECTOR_NAME> --type gcp --auth-method=service-account --project_id=<PROJECT_ID> --service_account_json=@connectors-vertex-ai-workload.json --resource-type gcp-generic\n\nzenml orchestrator register <ORCHESTRATOR_NAME> \\\n\n--flavor=vertex \\\n\n--location=<GCP_LOCATION> \\\n\n--synchronous=true \\\n\n--workload_service_account=<WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>@<PROJECT_NAME>.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n\nzenml orchestrator connect <ORCHESTRATOR_NAME> --connector <CONNECTOR_NAME>\n\nConfiguring the stack\n\nWith the orchestrator registered, we can use it in our active stack:\n\n# Register and activate a stack with the new orchestrator\n\nzenml stack register <STACK_NAME> -o <ORCHESTRATOR_NAME> ... --set\n\nZenML will build a Docker image called <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI>\/zenml:<PIPELINE_NAME> which includes your code and use it to run your pipeline steps in Vertex AI. Check out this page if you want to learn more about how ZenML builds these images and how you can customize them.\n\nYou can now run any ZenML pipeline using the Vertex orchestrator:\n\npython

{"anchor":"Kubernetes\n\nLearn how to deploy ZenML pipelines on a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe ZenML Kubernetes Orchestrator allows you to run your ML pipelines on a Kubernetes cluster without writing Kubernetes code. It's a lightweight alternative to more complex orchestrators like Airflow or Kubeflow.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo use the Kubernetes Orchestrator, you'll need:\n\nZenML kubernetes integration installed (zenml integration install kubernetes)\n\nDocker installed and running\n\nkubectl installed\n\nA remote artifact store and container registry in your ZenML stack\n\nA deployed Kubernetes cluster\n\nA configured kubectl context pointing to the cluster (optional, see below)\n\nDeploying the Orchestrator\n\nYou can deploy the orchestrator from the ZenML CLI:\n\nzenml orchestrator deploy k8s_orchestrator --flavor=kubernetes --provider=<YOUR_PROVIDER>\n\nConfiguring the Orchestrator\n\nThere are two ways to configure the orchestrator:\n\nUsing a Service Connector to connect to the remote cluster. This is the recommended approach, especially for cloud-managed clusters.

{"anchor":"Local Orchestrator\n\nOrchestrating your pipelines to run locally.\n\nThe local orchestrator is an orchestrator flavor that comes built-in with ZenML and runs your pipelines locally.\n\nWhen to use it\n\nThe local orchestrator is part of your default stack when you're first getting started with ZenML. Due to it running locally on your machine, it requires no additional setup and is easy to use and debug.\n\nYou should use the local orchestrator if:\n\nyou're just getting started with ZenML and want to run pipelines without setting up any cloud infrastructure.\n\nyou're writing a new pipeline and want to experiment and debug quickly\n\nHow to deploy it\n\nThe local orchestrator comes with ZenML and works without any additional setup.\n\nHow to use it\n\nTo use the local orchestrator, we can register it and use it in our active stack:\n\nzenml orchestrator register <ORCHESTRATOR_NAME> --flavor=local\n\n# Register and activate a stack with the new orchestrator\n\nzenml stack register <STACK_NAME> -o <ORCHESTRATOR_NAME> ... --set\n\nYou can now run any ZenML pipeline using the local

{"anchor":"Upgrade the version of the ZenML server\n\nLearn how to upgrade your server to a new version of ZenML for the different deployment options.\n\nThe way to upgrade your ZenML server depends a lot on how you deployed it.\n\nTo upgrade your ZenML server that was deployed with the zenml deploy command to a newer version, you can follow the steps below.\n\nIn the config file, set zenmlserver_image_tag to the version that you want your ZenML server to be running.\n\nRun the deploy command again with this config file:Copyzenml deploy --config=\/PATH\/TO\/FILE\n\nAny database schema updates are automatically handled by ZenML and unless mentioned otherwise, all of your data is migrated to the new version, intact.\n\nTo upgrade to a new version with docker, you have to delete the existing container and then run the new version of the zenml-server image.\n\nCheck that your data is persisted (either on persistent storage or on an external MySQL instance) before doing this.\n\nOptionally also perform a backup before the upgrade.\n\nDelete the existing ZenML container, for example like this:Copy# find your container ID\ndocker psCopy# stop the container\ndocker stop <CONTAINER_ID>\n\n# remove the container\ndocker rm <CONTAINER_ID>\n\nDeploy the version of the zenml-server image that you want to use. Find all versions here.Copydocker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name <CONTAINER_NAME> zenmldocker\/zenml-server:<VERSION>\n\nTo upgrade your ZenML server Helm release to a new version, follow the steps

{"anchor":"to your stack:\n\nzenml integration install azure -yThe only configuration parameter mandatory for registering an Azure Artifact Store is the root path URI, which needs to point to an Azure Blog Storage container and take the form az:\/\/container-name or abfs:\/\/container-name. Please read the Azure Blob Storage documentation on how to configure an Azure Blob Storage container.\n\nWith the URI to your Azure Blob Storage container known, registering an Azure Artifact Store can be done as follows:\n\n# Register the Azure artifact store\n\nzenml artifact-store register az_store -f azure --path=az:\/\/container-name\n\n# Register and set a stack with the new artifact store\n\nzenml stack register custom_stack -a az_store ... --set\n\nDepending on your use case, however, you may also need to provide additional configuration parameters pertaining to authentication to match your deployment scenario.\n\nAuthentication Methods\n\nIntegrating and using an Azure Artifact Store in your pipelines is not possible without employing some form of authentication. If you're looking for a quick way to get started locally, you can use the Implicit Authentication method. However, the recommended way to authenticate to the Azure cloud platform is through an Azure Service Connector. This is particularly useful if you are configuring ZenML stacks that combine the Azure Artifact Store with other remote stack components also running in Azure.\n\nYou will need the following information to configure Azure credentials for ZenML, depending on which type of Azure credentials you want to use:\n\nan Azure connection string\n\nan Azure account key\n\nthe client ID, client

{"anchor":"uter vision that expect a single dataset as input.model drift checks require two datasets and a mandatory model as input. This list includes a subset of the model evaluation checks provided by Deepchecks for tabular data and for computer vision that expect two datasets as input: target and reference.\n\nThis structure is directly reflected in how Deepchecks can be used with ZenML: there are four different Deepchecks standard steps and four different ZenML enums for Deepchecks checks . The Deepchecks Data Validator API is also modeled to reflect this same structure.\n\nA notable characteristic of Deepchecks is that you don't need to customize the set of Deepchecks tests that are part of a test suite. Both ZenML and Deepchecks provide sane defaults that will run all available Deepchecks tests in a given category with their default conditions if a custom list of tests and conditions are not provided.\n\nThere are three ways you can use Deepchecks in your ZenML pipelines that allow different levels of flexibility:\n\ninstantiate, configure and insert one or more of the standard Deepchecks steps shipped with ZenML into your pipelines. This is the easiest way and the recommended approach, but can only be customized through the supported step configuration parameters.\n\ncall the data validation methods provided by the Deepchecks Data Validator in your custom step implementation. This method allows for more flexibility concerning what can happen in the pipeline step, but you are still limited to the functionality implemented in the Data Validator.\n\nuse the Deepchecks library directly in your custom step implementation.

{"anchor":"uite a few extra methods specific to Label Studio.The core Label Studio functionality that's currently enabled includes a way to register your datasets, export any annotations for use in separate steps as well as start the annotator daemon process. (Label Studio requires a server to be running in order to use the web interface, and ZenML handles the provisioning of this server locally using the details you passed in when registering the component unless you've specified that you want to use a deployed instance.)\n\nStandard Steps\n\nZenML offers some standard steps (and their associated config objects) which will get you up and running with the Label Studio integration quickly. These include:\n\nLabelStudioDatasetRegistrationConfig - a step config object to be used when registering a dataset with Label studio using the get_or_create_dataset step\n\nLabelStudioDatasetSyncConfig - a step config object to be used when registering a dataset with Label studio using the sync_new_data_to_label_studio step. Note that this requires a ZenML secret to have been pre-registered with your artifact store as being the one that holds authentication secrets specific to your particular cloud provider. (Label Studio provides some documentation on what permissions these secrets require here.)\n\nget_or_create_dataset step - This takes a LabelStudioDatasetRegistrationConfig config object which includes the name of the dataset.

E.g.:\n\nmy_first_step.configure(output_materializers=MyMaterializer)\n\nWhen there are multiple outputs, a dictionary of type {<OUTPUT_NAME>: <MATERIALIZER_CLASS>} can be supplied to the decorator or the .configure(...) method:\n\nclass MyObj1:\n\n...\n\nclass MyObj2:\n\n...\n\nclass MyMaterializer1(BaseMaterializer):\n\n\"\"\"Materializer to read data to and from MyObj1.\"\"\"\n\nASSOCIATED_TYPES

{"anchor":" up the authentication resources, this is for you.These authentication methods deliver another way of configuring long-lived credentials in your Service Connectors without exposing them to clients. They are especially useful as an alternative to cloud provider Service Connectors authentication methods that do not support automatically downscoping the permissions of issued temporary tokens.\n\nThe processes of account impersonation and role assumption are very similar and can be summarized as follows:\n\nyou configure a Service Connector with long-lived credentials associated with a primary user account or primary service account (preferable). As a best practice, it is common to attach a reduced set of permissions or even no permissions to these credentials other than those that allow the account impersonation or role assumption operation. This makes it more difficult to do any damage if the primary credentials are accidentally leaked.\n\nin addition to the primary account and its long-lived credentials, you also need to provision one or more secondary access entities in the cloud platform bearing the effective permissions that will be needed to access the target resource(s):one or more IAM roles (to be assumed)one or more service accounts (to be impersonated)\n\nthe Service Connector configuration also needs to contain the name of a target IAM role to be assumed or a service account to be impersonated.\n\nupon request, the Service Connector will exchange the long-lived credentials associated with the primary account for short-lived API tokens that only have the permissions associated with the target IAM role or service account.

{"anchor":"Which files are built into the image\n\nZenML determines the root directory of your source files in the following order:\n\nIf you've initialized zenml (zenml init), the repository root directory will be used.\n\nOtherwise, the parent directory of the Python file you're executing will be the source root. For example, running python \/path\/to\/file.py, the source root would be \/path\/to.\n\nYou can specify how these files are handled using the source_files attribute on the DockerSettings:\n\nThe default behavior download_or_include: The files will be downloaded if they're inside a registered code repository and the repository has no local changes, otherwise, they will be included in the image.\n\nIf you want your files to be included in the image in any case, set the source_files attribute to include.\n\nIf you want your files to be downloaded in any case, set the source_files attribute to download. If this is specified, the files must be inside a registered code repository and the repository must have no local changes, otherwise the Docker build will fail.\n\nIf you want to prevent ZenML from copying or downloading any of your source files, you can do so by setting the source_files attribute on the Docker settings to ignore. This is an advanced feature and will most likely cause unintended and unanticipated behavior when running your pipelines. If you use this, make sure to copy all the necessary files to the correct paths yourself.\n\nWhich files get included\n\nWhen including files in the image, ZenML copies all contents of the root directory into the Docker image. To exclude files and keep the image smaller, use a .dockerignore file in either of the following ways:\n\nHave a file called .dockerignore in your source root directory.\n\nExplicitly specify a

If you want to update your version, you can simply select the 'Factory reboot' option within the 'Settings' tab of the space. Note that this will wipe any data contained within the space and so if you are not using a MySQL persistent database (as described above) you will lose any data contained within your ZenML deployment on the space.

This is the easiest way and the recommended approach, but can only be customized through the supported step configuration parameters.\n\ncall the data validation methods provided by the whylogs Data Validator in your custom step implementation. This method allows for more flexibility concerning what can happen in the pipeline step, but you are still limited to the functionality implemented in the Data Validator.\n\nuse the whylogs library directly in your custom step implementation. This gives you complete freedom in how you are using whylogs's features.\n\nYou can visualize whylogs profiles in Jupyter notebooks or view them directly in the ZenML dashboard.\n\nThe whylogs standard step\n\nZenML wraps the whylogs\/WhyLabs functionality in the form of a standard WhylogsProfilerStep step. The only field in the step config is a dataset_timestamp attribute which is only relevant when you upload the profiles to WhyLabs that uses this field to group and merge together profiles belonging to the same dataset. The helper function get_whylogs_profiler_step used to create an instance of this standard step takes in an optional dataset_id parameter that is also used only in the context of WhyLabs upload to

{"anchor":"Migration guide 0.23.0 \u2192 0.30.0\n\nHow to migrate from ZenML 0.20.0-0.23.0 to 0.30.0-0.39.1.\n\nMigrating to 0.30.0 performs non-reversible database changes so downgrading to <=0.23.0 is not possible afterwards. If you are running on an older ZenML version, please follow the 0.20.0 Migration Guide first to prevent unexpected database migration failures.\n\nThe ZenML 0.30.0 release removed the ml-pipelines-sdk dependency in favor of natively storing pipeline runs and artifacts in the ZenML database. The corresponding database migration will happen automatically as soon as you run any zenml ...

{"anchor":"Implement a custom stack component\n\nHow to write a custom stack component flavor\n\nWhen building a sophisticated MLOps Platform, you will often need to come up with custom-tailored solutions for your infrastructure or tooling. ZenML is built around the values of composability and reusability which is why the stack component flavors in ZenML are designed to be modular and straightforward to extend.\n\nThis guide will help you understand what a flavor is, and how you can develop and use your own custom flavors in ZenML.\n\nUnderstanding component flavors\n\nIn ZenML, a component type is a broad category that defines the functionality of a stack component. Each type can have multiple flavors, which are specific implementations of the component type. For instance, the type artifact_store can have flavors like local, s3, etc. Each flavor defines a unique implementation of functionality that an artifact store brings to a stack.\n\nBase Abstractions\n\nBefore we get into the topic of creating custom stack component flavors, let us briefly discuss the three core abstractions related to stack components: the StackComponent, the StackComponentConfig, and the Flavor.\n\nBase Abstraction 1: StackComponent\n\nThe StackComponent is the abstraction that defines the core functionality. As an example, check out the BaseArtifactStore definition below: The BaseArtifactStore inherits from StackComponent and establishes the public interface of all artifact stores. Any artifact store flavor needs to follow the standards set by this base class.\n\nfrom zenml.stack import StackComponent\n\nclass BaseArtifactStore(StackComponent):\n\n\"\"\"Base class for all ZenML

{"anchor":"e going to be starting with a very basic approach.First, let's understand what a service connector does. In simple words, a service connector contains credentials that grant stack components access to cloud infrastructure. These credentials are stored in the form of a secret, and are available to the ZenML server to use. Using these credentials, the service connector brokers a short-lived token and grants temporary permissions to the stack component to access that infrastructure. This diagram represents this process:\n\nThere are many ways to create an AWS service connector, but for the sake of this guide, we recommend creating one by using the IAM method.\n\nAWS_PROFILE=<AWS_PROFILE> zenml service-connector register cloud_connector --type aws --auto-configure\n\nThere are many ways to create a GCP service connector, but for the sake of this guide, we recommend creating one by using the Service Account method.\n\nzenml service-connector register cloud_connector --type gcp --auth-method service-account --service_account_json=@<PATH_TO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON> --project_id=<PROJECT_ID> --generate_temporary_tokens=False\n\nThere are many ways to create an Azure service connector, but for the sake of this guide, we recommend creating one by using the Service Principal method.\n\nzenml service-connector register cloud_connector --type azure --auth-method service-principal --tenant_id=<TENANT_ID> --client_id=<CLIENT_ID> --client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>\n\nOnce we have our service connector, we can now attach it to stack components. In this case, we are going to connect it to our remote artifact store:\n\nzenml artifact-store connect cloud_artifact_store --connector cloud_connector\n\nNow, every time you (or anyone else with access) uses the cloud_artifact_store, they will be granted a temporary token that will grant them access to the remote storage.
